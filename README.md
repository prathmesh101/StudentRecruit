Our application also covers up the financial aid providing by the university if it is beneficial or not. One of the main aspect to do a masterâ€™s course is to land up a job. This application provides a review of jobs and placements provided by the university and it include both on campus and full-time jobs. There is another section called as grad school finder. It will guide the student to view the list of university according to their scores. In this section the student basically must fill up a form which has course selection option, GRE and undergrad score must be entered, work experience, technical papers if published and ratings regarding statement of purpose, letter of recommendation, extracurricular and community service. Once the student has filled all the sections then the application will list the universities according to that criteria.
