    <string name="uni1_1">Arizona State University is a public research university founded in 1885. Located in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area, ASU is the largest public university in the USA in terms of enrolment. It’s also one of the universities most Indians apply to, without fail, since it qualifies as a ‘safe’ university, which means it’s pretty easy to get in. Mechanical, Electrical and Industrial courses are rated top notch at ASU.</string>

    <string name="uni1_2">If you’re at ASU, there’s a good chance that you’ll be studying at its Polytechnic Campus, a massive 600 acre setup which is a good 25 miles from the original Tempe campus. It’s not nearly half as good as the urban Tempe campus, but it’s pretty well made nevertheless. Constructed on a former Air Force base, the polytechnic campus has some excellent research labs, and very well made lecture halls. The Tempe campus, where you may have some of your lectures, is the oldest and arguably the best ASU campus, and has a couple of fantastic libraries, nice cafes, and wonderfully made recreational centers.</string>
    <string name="uni1_3">The ease of getting into a university doesn’t necessarily have a direct relation with how good a university is, and this is vindicated by ASU. It is definitely one of the better universities around, and has an excellent faculty. Many professors have relocated from Ivy League schools, while some are rather inexperienced and not-so-great, but one thing that’s common in all is an inherent desire to help students flourish. All professors are very approachable, and are willing to help students even beyond office hours. Oh but their accents might be a problem.</string>
    <string name="uni1_4">Well, some amount of need-based scholarship is common, but you need to maintain a good enough GPA to keep getting it.</string>
    <string name="uni1_5">One of the biggest plus-points of ASU is its massive alumni network. Fortunately, it’s as strong and active as it’s big. If you manage to get in touch with enough alumni, and make strong enough connections, you’ll see that it’s easy to make things start happening for you. And that includes placements.</string>
    <string name="uni1_6">The crowd is probably one of the major reasons why some students tend to ditch the academically better schools for ASU. Consistently ranked as one of the best party schools, Arizona State University is also known for the eye candy on offer. The soaring temperatures most of the year adds to the attraction – hot weather normally equals hot (small) clothes. That said, it’s also not too hard to find rather simple, down-to-earth folk who shy away from the limelight. Only if you want to look for them, of course.
While there’s enough to do even on campus, it’s a lot more fun if you venture outdoors. though the term ‘outdoors’ doesn’t exactly do justice to the convenient walk to a million bars right outside the ASU campus. There’s something for everyone, be it casual bars, romantic restaurants, pool parlours, wild drinking places, very wild drinking places, or extremely wild drinking places. ASU is known for its party scene, and there’s a very valid reason why – Mill Avenue next door has next to everything you could ask for.</string>
    <string name="uni1_7">Don’t be fooled by the overhyped and overstated notoriety of Arizona State University, unless that’s what is drawing you there. It’s a good school, and one you’ll never regret going to.</string>



    <string name="uni2_1">Northeastern University is a private research Institution located in Boston, Massachusetts, started in 1898. It’s a popular university amongst Indians. Most of the courses offered by this university are highly rated, and we believe that this has a lot to do with its strategic location.</string>
    <string name="uni2_2">Northeastern University has often been considered a model of design for urban universities and has twice won the Most Beautiful New or Renovated Exterior Space Award. It has a fantastic recreation centre, complete with a gymnasium and courts for basketball, volleyball, badminton and futsal. The library was opened in 1990 and consists of a whopping 1.3 million volumes. The campus also has a Spiritual Life </string>
    <string name="uni2_3">Northeastern University faculty members are world renowned and have also achieved international recognition for teaching and research. Among their faculty are a former Presidential candidate, a Pulitzer Prize Winner and other highly decorated scholars.
Northeastern University is known for its integration of classroom learning with real world experience. The university houses for more than 35 research and education centres.</string>
    <string name="uni2_4">Being a private university, and a pretty good one, NEU isn’t exactly too generous when it comes to dishing out scholarships. But you can certainly get by if you don’t mind giving some time to Teaching Assistance or Research Assistance.</string>
    <string name="uni2_5">Northeastern University has really good placements. A large number of fortune 500 companies such as Microsoft, Intuit, Proctre &amp;amp;amp;amp; Gamble, Disney, etc. visit the campus and offer excellent packages.</string>
    <string name="uni2_6">Life at Boston is, well, awesome! Innumerable places like Boston Common, Chinatown, and Fenway Park are very common with the NEUites. Roxy Nightclub and Tiger Lily are the favourite pubs, but that changes every few days, to be fair. Boston House of Pizza, P.F. Chang’s, The Cheesecake factory, T.G.I.F and Cappy’s Pizza are the favoured restaurants among the NEU hoi polloi.</string>
    <string name="uni2_7">Fantastic university, even better city. Should be within your sights if you have a decent profile, and should certainly be a preferred option.</string>



    <string name="uni3_1">Texas AM University, fondly called as TAMU, is a public research university founded in 1876. It is one of the best universities in the States as the research work and the opportunities opening after Graduation is spell bounding. Although applying to TAMU is nothing short of Ambitious, you stand a decent chance if you have an excellent research work and International papers to back your application. TAMU is a dream college for IITians and NITians.</string>
    <string name="uni3_2">The first thing that we’ll strike you about TAMU is its never-ending campus. It is spell over a massive 5200 acres, TAMU is a city within itself. In fact, Kyle Field (the most popular address in College Station) is also within the campus itself. It is completely self sufficient having 8 massive libraries that you can get lost in and enough cafeterias to keep you awake for a lifetime. It has a beautiful recreational centre filled with straight of the art facilities for any kind of sport.</string>
    <string name="uni3_3">The one thing that can’t be questioned is the qualification and brilliance of the professors at TAMU, College Station. However, you may sometimes have some trouble deciphering what they’re saying through their thick accents. It’s really important to attend all (or most, at least) lectures, since that really goes a long way in determining your grades. Professors are nice people from the inside, even if they seem a bit imposing and condescending from the outside, and they’ll be more than willing to help a ‘tryer’.</string>
    <string name="uni3_4">How much cheaper do you want it to be? Financial aid is almost as less as 5% but almost everyone gets a Research Assistantship and Teaching Assistantship based on their performance.</string>
    <string name="uni3_5">Since TAMU is one of the better colleges around, it certainly shouldn’t be a problem getting a pretty-high-paying job once you’re here. Where you get placed naturally depends on the course you’re doing, but more often than not, you can expect to get picked up by one of the top players in whatever field you’re specializing in.</string>
    <string name="uni3_6">The sheer size of TAMU means that you can find just about every kind of person on campus, ranging from the absolute nerds to those who just can’t stop partying. Although it must be known that there really isn’t much to do once you’re out of the campus, so it’s important – no, its imperative – that you find some people who you can hang out and party with.
The only place that really offers any kind of nightlife is Northgate, and there are a number of restaurants and bars that students hang out at, the most popular ones namely Dixie Chicken, Cheddar’s, Fox &amp;amp;amp;amp; Hound, Hurricane Harry’s and The Tap.</string>
    <string name="uni3_7">In all probability, you won’t get it. If you do, you should probably take it. The opportunities are endless, but prepare for two years of small-city life.</string>

    <string name="uni4_1">The University of Southern California is a private research University which was founded in 1880, making it California’s oldest private university. USC is involved in very high level research activity and thus has quickly risen up the ranking.
It may interest you that although USC claims that their students hail from 112 countries, but it feels a lot like India once you’re there.
</string>
    <string name="uni4_2">The USC campus is spread over 235 acres with two main libraries having more than a million volumes of all the possible topics in the world. ‘Traditions in the Lot’ is an on-campus Bar while Trojan Grounds and Ground Zero are the popular Cafeterias within the campus.</string>
    <string name="uni4_3">The faculty at Viterbi School of Engineering (USC’s engineering college) is renowned for being extremely knowledgeable, and even more approachable. Students are terribly impressed by the way professors maintain an admirable balance between teaching (and helping) students, and carrying out their own research work.</string>
    <string name="uni4_4">F-Aid is not very easy to get, which is probably the price you pay for a rather good ‘safe’ university.

</string>
    <string name="uni4_5">While getting a good, well-paying job should never be a problem – USC organizes excellent job fairs couple of times a year, where most students get picked up at fantastic salaries – you need to work pretty hard to ensure that you get a job that you really like doing, since the competition is pretty intense.</string>
    <string name="uni4_6">Students can be often be found at any of the following bars: 29th Street Café, the 901 Club, Saddle Ranch, Traditions. Also, areas that students hang out in are Santa Monica, SunSet Strip and Venus Beach. Del taco, Dinner at the Stanford, Denny’s, Jack in theBox are the 24 hours restaurant with Tommy’s Original, the hot favourite for a USC student. House Parties are very popular among the USCites.</string>
    <string name="uni4_7">USC is one of the few universities on the list of almost every Indian applicant. Don’t be fooled by the relative ease of getting in – this is one fantastic institute. The ideal university for rather conservative Indian students.</string>

    <string name="uni5_1">University of Texas – Dallas is a Tier 1 public research university started in the year 1969. In spite of being relatively ‘young’, UTD has already made a name for itself and is considered, as one of the finest universities for engineering and management. UTD ranks #21 in the world and #1 in US under Times Higher Education Young University rankings. The low fees, excellent research facilities, and exciting job prospects together make it an ideal destination for Indians, which is why they apply in such massive numbers.</string>
    <string name="uni5_2">University of Texas at Dallas is built on a lovely 710 acre campus. As a young university, UTD has focused on modern green infrastructure and has created world class research facilities in various areas of engineering, sciences, and management.</string>
    <string name="uni5_3">UT Dallas has grown rapidly in last ten years and has added many distinguished faculty that include members of National Academy and Fellows of various societies. A large number of new junior faculty have won prestigious awards, and numerous faculty hold endowed chairs in recognition of their contributions to education and research. UTD has had three Nobel Laureates on its faculty.

</string>
    <string name="uni5_4">Being a public university, UTD tends to be generous with scholarships, though you can’t take them for granted, since they’re all performance and/or need based. Of course, you can also always get Research Assistantships and Teaching Assistantships, especially if you’re Indian.</string>
    <string name="uni5_5">Some of the topmost fortune 100 companies are regularly hiring from UTD. UTD itself is surrounded by 500 companies and companies like Intel, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, Apple, and more are commonly seen hiring in big numbers from Engineering and Computer Science.

</string>
    <string name="uni5_6">While the crowd isn’t exactly multicultural – you’ll just find a crazy number of Indians – it certainly doesn’t mean that it’s bad. You can always find your type of people, it’s said.
Life on campus can become pretty boring. There isn’t much to do in and around the place, and students’ woes are compounded by the fact that there isn’t a bar on campus. However, there are a number of perfectly good restaurants around, with Papa Johns and Subway being crowd-pullers.</string>
    <string name="uni5_7">It is a rapidly rising university that attained Tier I research status in the heart of one of the largest metroplex areas in US. It is one of top three public universities in the state of Texas.

</string>

    <string name="uni6_1">Founded in 1895, University of Texas at Arlington fondly called as UT Arlington or UTA, is a public research university located in the state of Texas. Even though the university is part of the same group, ‘University of Texas’, the institution is ranked pretty low in the US of A. With the likes of the extremely ambitious Texas Austin and TAMU, followed by the hot favourite Texas at Dallas, Arlington looses out on the big league of Institutions. In spite of this, the college is preferred by a lot of Asians, especially Indians, with just an about average profile for Electrical and Telecomm courses majorly.

</string>
    <string name="uni6_2">The university is spread over 420 acres and covers round about 100 odd buildings. There are a few main libraries which cover thousands of volumes of all the possible courses. Many recreational centers, coffee houses, bars and students study centre completes the infrastructure of the UTA.

</string>
    <string name="uni6_3">Well, the faculty at UTA is pretty renowned for their achievements till date. You definitely meet a lot of Nobel laureates, followed by Phd degrees and what not. Some are too stubborn and arrogant and students prefer to stay away from them. Most of them are busy doing their own research, hence its advised that students should approach the respective professor for any particular work. Sometimes, you’ve to keep pushing your respective project guide to get your work done. In a nutshell, the professors are quite excellent though the quality is unbeatable in the ambitious Texas Universities.

</string>
    <string name="uni6_4">Being a state funded Research University, UTA is known for its scholarships and the financial aid. Generally, the college gives you F-aid (famous among the student community) but your profile should be impressive enough as well. If you’re up to date with your academics, assignments and projects, Research and Teaching Assistantship (RA and TA) is on your way.

</string>
    <string name="uni6_5">One of the states where the country’s economy runs through is Texas. Hence, you can expect to see a lot MNC’s situated within hundreds of cities of this state. Though most of the companies prefer students from Dallas and Austin, the legacy of the name TEXAS follows it to Arlington as well. Roughly, the pay package starts from anything around $35,000.

</string>
    <string name="uni6_6">You see a great diversity of students in UTA; sadly, they are all from the various states and cities of US of A. You’re expected to see a good amount of Indians in the Electrical and Telecomm courses, for which the college is very famous. The ratio of boys and girls is pretty equal but the latter outdo the former in appearance, dressing sense and clothes.

    <string name="uni7_1">University of Buffalo, a public research university Established in 1846, is the largest university among all the SUNY universities. Again, this is one of the hot favourites among all Graduation students due its amazingly low fees and strategic location. Almost every Indian applies to this college after reading the above the lines (Don’t be ashamed, there’s nothing wrong in that).

</string>
    <string name="uni7_2">SUNY Buffalo is somewhat divided into three different locations/campuses. They are: ‘Amherst’ where the North Campus is located, ‘Heights’ surrounded by hundreds of shops and big brick houses in the South Campus and ‘Buffalo’ itself. The campus on a whole is spread over 1350 acres. The architecture of the university looks like it’s come straight out of a 70’s movie, especially the North and South Campus. The university contains nine main libraries having more than 3 million volumes of all possible topics/courses in the world.

</string>
    <string name="uni7_3">SUNY Buffalo is one of the most productive research universities in the States, and naturally credit goes to its professors. But there are a few ‘not completely amazing’ professors, like anywhere else, and students tend to avoid their classes. Some are pretty helpful and go out of their way for students. All in all, SUNY Buffalo is well known for its research work, less low and soaring reputation, so really, how much does the faculty matter?

</string>
    <string name="uni7_4">Come on, isn’t the awfully low fee enough? We’re here to cater to your need, not your greed.
That being said, the university is still nice enough to dish out a few need-based scholarships. Plus, you can always obtain Teaching Assistantships or Research Assistantships at Buffalo. How very nice of them.</string>
    <string name="uni7_5">Being one of the major universities in the state of New York, SUNY Buffalo certainly offers excellent placements. Fantastic job profiles with excellent packages are there for the taking, you just have to make sure you do enough in your time at college to get them.

</string>
    <string name="uni7_6">At SUNY Buffalo, you can be sure of a mixed, multicultural crowd, with a slight majority of Asians. Every student can certainly find more people like oneself, so life shouldn’t be too hard.
</string>
    <string name="uni7_7">SUNY Buffalo certainly ranks pretty high in the rankings for most courses, but somehow it’s not completely impossible to get in. Should be one of the universities one should look to get into, especially if the fees is a deciding factor.

</string>

    <string name="uni8_1">North Carolina State University (NCSU) is a public research university started in 1887. It has an enrollment of over 30,000 students, making it the largest university in Carolina by a margin. It’s also one of the cheaper universities around and hence is extremely popular amongst students. NCSU is especially well known for programs like ECE, CSC and Computer Networking (which is offered in very few other universities), and this fact coupled with its low tuition fees makes it a dream college for many a student.</string>
    <string name="uni8_2">NCSU’s main campus has three sub campuses, North, Central and South. Although your life would be pretty much centered around the Engineering buildings (which is in the wonderful centennial campus), you should definitely take a few long walks around the rest of the campus, because well, it’s quite breathtakingly beautiful. Add to that the fact that all the libraries, laboratories and research centers are state-of-the-art, and you get the perfect ‘university feel’. The gym, recreation center and the sports/athletic facilities are mind-blowing as well. The brand new Hunt Library is certainly one of the most amazing structures you\\'ll ever see. Magnificent and hi-tech, it is the worlds first artificial intelligence involved library. In a word, it\'s brilliant.</string>
    <string name="uni8_3">Most students are full of praise for the professors, although there’s a common complaint that not all professors are equally approachable. We would think that quite obvious, so we choose to believe that the faculty, on an average, is pretty excellent. It\'s common to hear students go Ooh my God, they\'re amazing! They\'ll make you fall in love with the subject! when quizzed about their teachers. Professors go out of their way to help, provided the initiative comes from the students. Plus, the course is structured in such a way so as to give you excellent practical as well as theoretical knowledge. NCSU also has a rather excellent Tutorial Center, where you can get free one-on-one help whenever you may need it. Now don’t go and spend all day there even if you don’t need any assistance; save such cheapness for your native land, where it’s certainly more appreciated.</string>
    <string name="uni8_4">It\'s impossible to get a scholarship, and even Teaching or Research internships are highly difficult to get. Any kind of financial aid is very, very difficult to get because you\'ll be competing with about 1000 people, most of who will probably have better profiles and marks. The best chance you have of getting some kind of funding is if you\'re doing a thesis under a professor, but those are terribly hard to get too- you normally need to either have industry experience or be a PhD student to get TAs or Ras.</string>
    <string name="uni8_5">Where and how well you get placed has a lot to do with what course you’re studying, and your performance in it. A fantastic number of companies visit the campus, and offer brilliant jobs, but you have to struggle and really work hard to get placed. Companies like Cisco, Netapp, EMC, Yahoo, Amazon, RIM, Google, Microsoft, nVidia, Intel, Qualcomm and IBM are regular recruiters, so clearly your life is quite set once you get yourself a job.

</string>
    <string name="uni8_6">People from all over the world come to NCSU. There\'s a dominance of \'Asians\' (Chinese and Korean students), but there are a number of Indians and Arabs as well. All are highly competitive and quite talented, so you\'re really going to have to slog to make it big here. But it\'s a lot of fun as well; they have a fantastic organisation which helps new Indian students at NCSU settle in, and also organizes various events during Diwali, Holi, etc.
</string>
    <string name="uni8_7">It\'s a fantastic university, which is quickly climbing up the rankings. A major downside is the fact that it\'s not in a very big city, but other than that, NCSU is wonderful.

</string>


    <string name="uni9_1">Georgia Institute of Technology, more commonly known as Georgia Tech, is one of the most reputed public research universities in the world. Founded in 1885, GeorgiaTech initially started with core programs like mechanical, civil and aerospace engineering. But in the early 1900s, it started a host of other programs, and now is highly reputed for ALL of its courses as well.
</string>
    <string name="uni9_2">Now, there isn’t a hell of a lot to do in the state of Georgia, but thankfully the GT campus is more than enough for students. The campus is self-sufficient, complete with state-of-the-art infrastructure and facilities for just about anything a student might want to do. They have a brilliant library, and some dazzling research centers and laboratories as well.

</string>
    <string name="uni9_3">One thing that no one complains about at GTech is the faculty. All professors are said to be absolutely excellent, many of them even being Nobel laureates. While some students begrudge the fact that many professors are more involved in their research than in teaching, it would be unfair not to consider that they are more than helpful if students show enough dedication and sincerity.

</string>
    <string name="uni9_4">Many students (specially Asians) get some scholarships in the first semester, but then onwards it becomes really really difficult. RAs and TAs are almost impossible to get, as the PhD students are naturally given preference.

</string>
    <string name="uni9_5">Students get placed in a host of companies and normally have enough choices on their table. The average packages for most engineering courses are in the range of $65,000-80,000 per year.

</string>
    <string name="uni9_6">Being primarily an engineering institute, Georgia Tech has rather low female enrolment, but this has been significantly improving over the years. Around 40% of the students in graduate programs are Asian, but overall there is an excellent mix of students from a variety of cultural and socio-economic backgrounds.
</string>
    <string name="uni9_7">GaTech has been consistently ranked in the top 10 international universities every year, and there’s a very good reason for this. Should definitely be one of the institutes you aim for.

</string>


    <string name="uni10_1">University of Illinois at Chicago is a public research university founded in 1858 and located in the large city of Chicago. UIC, ranked in the Top-50 universities in the United States, is one of the common graduation colleges which you find on the list of every average profile. The university gets a lot of applicants from Asia and is generally preferred by Mechanical Engineering students.
</string>
    <string name="uni10_2">The campus size at UIC is roughly about 311 acres, which is quite massive for a campus in the middle of a big city. The university has three main libraries covering more than thousands of volumes of all the possible courses. Apart from the excellent academics offered by the institution, there is a recreational centre within the campus where you find most of the students chilling. There’s also a theater, and a number of coffee shops within the campus.

</string>
    <string name="uni10_3">Everyone at UIC must be cursing the college’s luck. Because, if UIUC (the neighbours at Urbana-Champaign) didn’t exist, UIC would definitely have been the best college in Illinois. As things stand, however, it gets somewhat stepbrotherly treatment. But that’s only from casual observers, since anyone who knows would know pretty well that the faculty at Chicago is rather excellent. The brilliant location ensures that the college attracts the best of professors from all across the world. The research facilities at UIC are terrific, and just about everything about the colleges academics is top notch.

</string>
    <string name="uni10_4">As the college is funded by the state of Illinois, students tend to get some financial aid in University of Illinois, Chicago provided your profile is worth it. Having said that, students definitely get a good Research and Teaching Assistantship along with part time jobs, considering the great prospects of this city.

</string>
    <string name="uni10_5">Perhaps the strongest advantage UIC has over most colleges in the country is its extremely strategic location. Chicago is one of the biggest cities in the world, and the fact that it’s full of opportunities pretty much ensures that you’re quite sorted (in terms of getting a job, not getting stoned/smashed) if you’re studying at UIC.

</string>
    <string name="uni10_6">Students are usually quite busy with the rigorous academic work and research yet they party every week, sometimes twice a week. When you’re in the city of Chicago, you aren’t left out with options. The UIC campus has multiple places to check out followed by hundreds of local bars and cafes off campus where you see UIC students spending their days (oh, nights too). Downtown, Navy Pier, Lake front, Wicker Park are the common and popular areas for the state students to hangout. Students are in love with the nightlife at UIC as there are many discotheques and bars according to themes like Zentra, V Live and Bon V.

</string>
    <string name="uni10_7">While it’ll be unfair to mention its name in the same breath as UI-Urbana Champaign, UI-Chicago still is an excellent university nevertheless. Oh and the location really helps.

</string>

    <string name="uni11_1">As the name quite clearly suggests, the University of Texas at Austin is located at, well, Austin in Texas. Being the ‘live music capital’ of the world, Austin witnesses a massive number of concerts week in week out. It’s a nice, laid-back place, where the major modes of transport are bikes, cabs or just foot. Shuttle buses are available within the university, though.
Most graduate students live off-campus, because it’s cheaper and you get a little more freedom (though Indians wouldn’t be used to even the on-campus levels of freedom; they stay off-campus only for one reason). Three major off-campus options are West Campus, North Campus and Riverside, of which West is quite expensive. The other two are slightly more affordable, but they’re further away from the UTA campus.
</string>
    <string name="uni11_2">The UTA campus is spread over 350 acres, complete with all sorts of state-of-the-art facilities for anything you can think of. They have 17 huge libraries, having over a million publications between them. There are as many as SEVEN museums within the campus! There is a bar within the campus (oh yes, you read it right) called Cactus Cafe, and a Starbucks Café as well. They also have a bowling alley, and a quite fantastic movie theatre.

</string>
    <string name="uni11_3">University of Austin – Texas is one of the most popular universities around, and you don’t have to look beyond the faculty and the research facilities to gauge why. Among the faculty are recipients of the Nobel Prize, the Pulitzer Prize, the Wolf Prize, and the National Medal of Science. A lot of emphasis is laid on research, and the institute’s infrastructure has been designed in such a way so as to make research an absolute joy.

</string>
    <string name="uni11_4">Scholarships as such aren’t exactly common, but students often apply for RA/TA (Research Assistantship and Teaching Assistantship).

</string>
    <string name="uni11_5">University of Texas at Austin isn’t one of the top universities of the world for nothing. Along with their brilliant faculty and research, they also boast of getting the best of companies visiting them, best of job profiles, and some fantastic salaries being offered to their students.

</string>
    <string name="uni11_6">Most students like Austin because it gives the feel of a small-town (obviously it will. It IS one, isn’t it?). You’ll often find weird things happening in different parts of Texas, like naked swimming at Hippy Hollow.
Some major areas where you’ll see some of the ‘Texas Nightlife’ are Sixth Street, Red River, etc. Favourite hangouts of students include Chewy’s, Magnolia Café, Hula Hut, Iron Cactus, Fuel, Trody’s, etc. For any of those nocturnal folks that may be interested, there’s Burger King, Magnolia Café, Ihop, Ken’s Donuts, etc. And for anyone who wants to get smashed, students recommend ‘Purple’ at Baby A’s. Not bad for a ‘small city’.

</string>
    <string name="uni11_7">Well, give it a shot, but you probably won\'t get in, unless you have a profile that matches their ambition. Which is pretty bloody high.

</string>

    <string name="uni12_1">Illinois Institute of Technology is a private research university located in Chicago, Illinois. It was founded in the year 1940, when the erstwhile Armour Institute of Technology and Lewis Institute merged into one. Although you wouldn’t find this school in anyone’s Top 5 list, it’s actually pretty good for Electrical and Computer Engineering. This, coupled with the fact that it’s in full-of-opportunities Chicago, makes it a decent choice for students with not-so-great profiles. Also, it has a pretty high acceptance rate, so most students can expect to get it.

</string>
    <string name="uni12_2">The one thing that makes IIT so popular is its location. Chicago has been voted as one of the best cities in the world to live in, and it’s one of the major financial capitals as well. It’s also a hugely busy city, which would be very clear when you see the endless activity. To add to all of this, it’s extremely safe (well, most of it). Full marks for location, although one thing that may not agree too well with you is the weather…

</string>

    <string name="uni12_3">Now the jobs you get hugely depend on the course you’re doing, and even more on your performance in the course. Since Chicago has a world of opportunities, yes you’ll probably end up with a job, but it may or may not be to your liking. Don’t forget that IIT isn’t the greatest of universities, and if there’s another recession (which seems likely every once in a while now), just hope that it doesn’t get caught out in the cold when it comes to placements.


</string>
    <string name="uni12_4">You’ll find an alarmingly large number of Asians at IIT. This should seem normal for most graduate programs, but the difference here is that there’s a massive influx of Asians even for the undergrad programs. Students are allegedly less interested in outdoor activities (sports, for example) and more interested in indoor activities (video games. Oh god). And of course, the boy/girl ratio is about 4:1. Engineering, we tell you.

    <string name="uni14_1">University of North Carolina at Charlotte, usually referred as UNCC or simply Charlotte, is a public research university founded in 1871. The university is pretty famous for its Electrical Engineering and Computer Science programs and is always on the application list of an average profile. UNC of Charlotte is a hot favourite university for Asians, especially Indians, considering the strategic location and easily affordable fees.
</string>
    <string name="uni14_2">Spreading over a small 250 acres, UNCC has one of the best campuses in the States. Starting from the Student union, to the library which have millions of volumes of all possible books, from cafes and bars to the high class and well maintained gymnasium, the university has every possible thing you want under the sun.

</string>
    <string name="uni14_3">The academic teaching at UNCC is pretty excellent. While you meet professors who have done their PhD’s from the best institutes in the world, you meet a lot of Nobel laureates and multiple degrees. Students are pretty satisfied with the teaching level of the professors. Teachers are highly co-operative and easy to approach provided you attend the lectures regularly. Professors are helpful during projects, obviously you’ve to make a move.

</string>
    <string name="uni14_4">As the name suggests, the university is a public university sponsored by the state North Carolina. Thus, you can expect a good amount of F-aid, provided your profile is worth a waiver. Research and Teaching Assistantship (RA &amp;amp;amp; TA) are easily gettable if you’re up to date in your submissions, term exams and communication skills.

</string>
    <string name="uni14_5">Even though the college isn’t highly ranked in the States, the eventual placements are quite above average compared to the universities of the same league. As mentioned earlier, being the best banking sector of the country, you can expect enormous placements in the field of banking, finance, mutual funds in world class MNC’s with a starting salary from anything around $40,000.

</string>
    <string name="uni14_6">The crowd at UNCC is pretty above average with an equal sex ratio, we mean boys and girls. Since, the university is located in a pretty busy area of Charlotte; the night life of this college is quite commendable. Students are seen partying in the downtown Charlotte in pubs and restaurants like Butter, Phoenix and Suite.
Though most of the students prefer to discotheques and pubs, you’ll find a major number holding a house party every weekend!

</string>
    <string name="uni14_7">Though UNC Charlotte is not in the big league of colleges and is always preferred after NCSU, the high class city, excellent economical background, tolerable weather, and extremely low fees, make this college on the wish list of just an about average profile.

</string>


    <string name="uni15_1">San Jose State University is a public research university located in San Jose, California. Founded in 1857, it’s the oldest public university on the West Coast of the USA. SJSU also boasts the highest foreign student enrollment in the whole of the United States, which in a nutshell means that it’s not really too much of a task to get in.

</string>
    <string name="uni15_2">Built over 150 acres, the SJSU campus has a nice blend of some nearly-ancient and some very recently constructed buildings. There is a great amount of history behind what the campus looks like today, complete with fires and earthquakes and mass demolition. But the one thing that cannot be doubted is that the infrastructure is excellent, and the facilities are top-notch. They have a fantastic athletics center near the main campus, and they have a stunning 8-storey library which won the Library of the Year award in 2004. Magnificent.

</string>
    <string name="uni15_3">Now, San Jose State is certainly not among the best schools around, and it certainly doesn’t have the kind of professors that, say, UC-Berkeley or UIUC or Stanford has to offer. But what this university CAN boast of, is the fact that all the professors are highly dedicated and committed, and are more than willing to do anything in their considerable power to help students.

</string>
    <string name="uni15_4">Since it’s a public university, scholarships are possible to obtain, but they’re never easy to come by. You have to maintain rather high academics throughout, plus you need to, well, need the scholarship. What’s much easier to get is a teaching or research based assistantship.

</string>
    <string name="uni15_5">While we’re going to be honest and admit that we couldn’t find much information about how good or bad the placements at SJSU are, what we CAN tell you is that their career center is quite brilliant. Most students get placed quite well, and the career center goes out of their way to ensure that the ‘career fairs’ are successful.

</string>
    <string name="uni15_6">Since the school has such a massive intake, you can be certain to meet a wide range of people from different cultural, geographic and socio-economic backgrounds. One thing is certain – you will definitely find enough people who you can relate to.
</string>
    <string name="uni15_7">While it’s possible that you could aim higher, San Jose State University is by no means a bad school. Oh, and there’s no place like California.

</string>

    <string name="uni16_1">Started in the year 1900, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) is a private research university in Pittsburgh. It is one of the best colleges for just about any course, which is why it’s a ‘dream college’ for almost every Asian student. It’s pretty expensive, though, so that’s something you have to keep in mind.

</string>
    <string name="uni16_2">CMU is spread over 140 acres of greenery, and is quite beautifully maintained. There are a number of fantastic libraries, all up-to-date with tens of thousands of volumes. CMU has excellent facilities for almost all sports and recreation, and even has its own theatre.

</string>
    <string name="uni16_3">Most of the professors at CMU are highly reputed stalwarts of their own fields, and are at the university for further research. Having said that, they are still extremely approachable, and also take teaching very seriously. The student-professor relationship depends largely on what the students make out of it.
</string>
    <string name="uni16_4">CMU being a private university, scholarships are hard to come by. It does offer a few grants though, but you have to be pretty lucky (and really good) to get those too.

</string>
    <string name="uni16_5">The placements at CMU are absolutely first-grade. Some of the Who’s Who in the fields of IT, Consultancy, etc are major recruiters at the institute. Intel, Accenture, IBM, Harris, Bank of America, Microsoft, Oracle, Nvidia etc hire students in numbers, at fantastic salaries.

</string>
    <string name="uni16_6">The crowd at CMU is excellent, although the male-female ratio isn’t exactly very healthy. Although there’s a hell of a lot to study all the time, students do find time to pursue other extracurriculars, and party a bit of course. Forbes and Fifth Avenue are the most common hangouts for CMU students. Oakland, Shadyside, South Side, Station Square and Strip District are well known for their nightlife. You’ll find a string of decent restaurants and cool bars here, and a number of concerts take place in the area as well. Some of the most frequented spots are Dejavu Lounge, Tequila Willies, Matrix, Panther Hollow Inn, Rolling Rock, Club Havana, Fuel and Fuddle, Taste of India, Buffalo Blues, etc. There are a number of 24 hour cafes/restaurants, some of which are Eat n Park, Ritter’s Diner, Tom’s Diner, etc.

</string>
    <string name="uni16_7">Definitely a top-5 institute in the US, perhaps a top-10 institute in the world. CMU should definitely be on every student’s wish-list.

</string>

    <string name="uni17_1">University of Maryland College Park is a public institution that was founded in 1856. Its setting is suburban, and the campus size is 1,250 acres. The University of Maryland has a highly ranked graduate program in education and the noted A. James Clark School of Engineering (ranked at #22 on US News Rankings), as well as well-regarded offerings through the Robert H. Smith School of Business. The university regularly earns accolades for its sustainable and clean energy initiatives, such as its plan to be carbon neutral by 2050 and campus-wide efforts to compost dining hall waste.

</string>
    <string name="uni17_2">Having a huge campus of 1250 acres, UMD is known for its Red-brick Georgian buildings. The Center point for the university is a lawn called McKeldin Mall, the university with a spectacular number of 7500 trees on campus. The Mall houses the McKeldin Library (named after an ex-governor) which has a good collection of books and study space. The most popular Testudo statue, which as a tradition is touched for good luck, is placed right outside the library. The XFINITY Center is where great basketball games are played. Another stadium is the Capitol One filed Stadium which is the older one and is used for smaller games.
</string>
    <string name="uni17_3">Faculty to student ratio is 1:17 with total faculty and staff to be around 9000. The class sizes go from about 30 to 40. UMD has been home to 4 Nobel Laureates who have been faculties. Students know the Sciences classes to be very hard and the English classes to be extremely delightful. Professors are known to be passionate about subject and teaching. Students find it very difficult to get good grades here and one needs to work very hard. Popular professors are Dr James Glass (Politics), Dr Eugenie Clark (Oceanography), etc.

</string>
    <string name="uni17_4">At UMD, the in-state fees are dollar 10,000 and out-state fees is about 30,000. There are various recruitment fellowships such as Flagship Fellowship, Ronald McNair Graduate Fellowship, University, Dean\'s &amp; Merit Fellowship. Merit-based awards for academic excellence are All STAR Fellowship, Phi Delta Gamma Fellowship, Outstanding Graduate Assistantship Award, etc.

</string>
    <string name="uni17_5">Students appreciate the internships (62% students opt for paid internships in over 167 internship experiences) that they get their hands on during their study in the college. Average alumni salary is $50,000 with agriculture, biological sciences and education related majors fetching $45,000 and Engineering and related majors fetching $60,000-$75000. Highest salary range (above $1,00,000) is seen in Technology, Biotechnology and Consulting firms.
</string>
    <string name="uni17_6">More than 37000 students (10000 graduate students and 3500 graduate international students from China, India, South Korea, Taiwan, etc.), the University of Maryland boasts of its diversity of students from 50 states and 118 countries. The gender ratio is 52% males and 48% females. It has 800 clubs for students to try their hands on and the Greek Life is pretty much going on. Students love the libraries and the gym. The food is average and students recommend to cook one\'s own food. NCAA Division 1 and sports scene is very good. Men\'s soccer team and women\'s hockey team have won many awards. There is a huge Golf course on campus with tournaments happening all year round.
</string>
    <string name="uni17_7">It’s a large school which can show you big dreams. Students can become invisible if they want or they can also find their niche. If you dont like big campuses, only then this school is a challenge.

</string>

    <string name="uni18_1">Founded in 1853, the University of Florida (UF or UFL) is a public research university located at Gainesville, Florida. While the university is commonly known as the number one party school in the US, it’ s also pretty famous for its academics. This little combination, along with the fact that it isn’t too hard to get in, ensures that UFL is a hot favourite among Indians.

</string>
    <string name="uni18_2">The University of Florida is built on a lovely 2000 acre campus in the heart of Gainesville (Well, naturally, considering that the school IS the heart of Gainesville). It has an excellent library system with 3 main libraries, which together have over 4 million volumes between them. The university has excellent recreation centers, with state-of-the-art facilities for all kinds of sports and games. Oh and the lecture halls, auditoriums and laboratories and pretty dazzling as well, of course.

</string>
    <string name="uni18_3">Now, you wouldn’t normally expect the faculty at a public university to be out-of-the-world nice, but there’s something about UFL that brings the best out of even the most stone-hearted professors. As long as you take some initiative and make some efforts, professors are more than willing to help you out.
</string>
    <string name="uni18_4">Not only is the fees low, but they’re also pretty generous with financial aid. Many students get some kind of scholarship, the amount increases with the quality of your profile.

</string>
    <string name="uni18_5">Since University of Florida is one of the better colleges around, it certainly shouldn’t be a problem getting a pretty-high-paying job once you’re here. Where you get placed naturally depends on the course you’re doing, but more often than not, you can expect to get picked up by one of the top players in whatever field you’re specializing in.

</string>
    <string name="uni18_6">Well, one thing that needs to be mentioned is that everyone loves partying. Nerds would feel terribly out of place here. There are a lot of tanned, and rather dirty, people everywhere. But well you get used to it. And if you’re Indian, you probably are already.
</string>
    <string name="uni18_7">For someone with a good profile, UFL is perhaps a Safe university to apply, but that’s where the ‘safety’ ends. Florida is notorious for its crime scene, though students say that they’re quite safe in and around the campus. Having said that, the college is excellent, and the crime scene really isn’t ALL that bad, so breathe easy.

</string>


    <string name="uni19_1">Started in 1869, Purdue University is a public research university located in West Lafayette, Indiana. It is one of the highest-rated universities in the USA, and rightly so. It is involved in very high levels of research, and has some of the best academic programs to offer. Before you read any further, you ought to know that you need an absolutely mind-boggling profile to get into Purdue. An extremely high GPA, some excellent research work, and a couple of international technical papers can give you a chance of making it to Purdue. Note how we say ‘can’ and not ‘will’ – it really is that hard. To get an idea, even IITians with breathtakingly good profiles find it difficult to get in.

</string>
    <string name="uni19_2">Purdue University is built on a massive 2500 acre campus, and is arguably one of the best campuses you’ll ever see (that is, of course, if you’re lucky enough to see it). Completely self-sufficient, Purdue has anything and everything a student could possibly ask for, including fifteen (yes, fifteen) massive libraries, a number of coffee shops, convenience stores, and a number of casual hangouts as well.

</string>
    <string name="uni19_3">Students come to Purdue mainly because of the faculty. A number of Nobel laureates teach at the university, and in spite of their high levels of research work, they’re quite approachable and friendly. Professors are more than willing to go out of their way to help, provided students are willing to go out of theirs to learn. Students sometimes complain about professor\'s accents being a problem, albeit a very minor one, so that really shouldn’t influence your judgment.
</string>
    <string name="uni19_4">It’s pretty easy to get Teaching and Research Assistantships, but its nigh impossible to get any substantial scholarships, mainly because of the kind of competition you face for it.

</string>
    <string name="uni19_5">Well, it’s Purdue. Graduates from here end up as the top brass in some of the topmost companies of the world. Naturally, placements are fantastic, but if you have a very particular job/company combination that you dream of, then you better make sure your academics merit it, because the quality, if not quantity, of competition you face is frightening.

</string>
    <string name="uni19_6">Like we already mentioned, Purdue University is absolutely self-sufficient, having a bowling alley, and an excellent food court of its own. Still, for those who like moving out a bit, Chauncey Hill and The Levee would be nice places to start. Where Else, BW3’s, XXX and Neon Cactus are some of the popular grad hangouts.

</string>
    <string name="uni19_7">The only negative is the weather, and maybe the location, to an extent, if you’re used to a big city. But everything else – and that’s what matters – about Purdue is absolutely fantastic.

</string>


    <string name="uni20_1">Pennsylvania State University, commonly referred to as Penn State or PSU, is a public research university which was started in 1855 in the state of Pennsylvania, USA. Penn State is a high ranked college and is often considered as a Public Ivy League in America. Since it’s an ambitious public university, it’s a hot favourite among Asians, especially Indians, as the tuition fee is quite affordable. Having said that, it’s quite difficult to make it to this university considering the number of applicants they get here.

</string>
    <string name="uni20_2">To start off with, the campus size of Penn State is a massive 5,500 acres with many recreational centres. The HUB is the epicentre of the campus where you find maximum students occupied with something or the other. There are two main libraries followed by small five libraries having more than 2 million volumes. Sadly, there is no bar on the campus but there are hundreds of coffee shops. Okay, not hundreds, but well you get the idea.

</string>
    <string name="uni20_3">Although Penn State University isn’t particularly known for excellent faculty, the students say that it’s just that. All professors are highly renowned in their fields, and fortunately this doesn’t get into their heads too much – they are always approachable, friendly and willing to go out of their way to help students.

</string>
    <string name="uni20_4">As it’s a public university, you can expect some amount of Financial Aid provided your profile commands it. Moreover, since the college is of the Public Ivy League calibre, not many get scholarships, though Research Assistantships and Teaching Assistantships aren’t a problem.

</string>
    <string name="uni20_5">If you’re a Penn State graduate, you’re surely paid a handsome salary by companies like IBM, Boeing, Johnson and Johnson, Bank of America.

</string>
    <string name="uni20_6">Though there are a good number of Asians in this university, the Americans win the battle of looks. You can expect to see a decent number of studs and hot girls lazing around in the campus, obviously during summer. There are hundreds of recreational facilities in Penn State campus and many cafeterias. The nightlife at Penn State is quite famous. The popular areas/places for partying are College Avenue, Café 210 and Indigo.

</string>
    <string name="uni20_7">Good college, good affordability, good prospects. If only the chances of getting in are good.

</string>


    <string name="uni21_1">The University of California, San Diego is a public research university founded in 1960 in the La Jolla neighbourhood of San Diego. Students with an average profile should know that it’s not easy to get in UCSD. Asians, especially Indians, aim for this university primarily for two reasons:
</string>
    <string name="uni21_2">UCSD is built over 1200 acres and has a very modern architecture compared to most of the universities, perhaps because it’s one of the ‘newer’ universities. All the buildings are state of the art with all kinds of modern equipments in place. There are 6 main libraries in the campus and also a well equipped bar and coffee shop on the campus.

</string>
    <string name="uni21_3">Although students sometimes complain that some professors are more bothered about their own research than teaching, their quality can certainly not be doubted. It is said that more often than not professors are helpful and are willing to go out of their way to help students.

</string>
    <string name="uni21_4">It’s difficult to get a financial aid, but because it’s a public research university, hence the fee is pretty much affordable. Moreover, since the university selects students of great profiles, you need to have some amazing achievements in your profile to get some kind of scholarship.

</string>
    <string name="uni21_5">UCSD has good placements overall, but you should bear in mind that you’ll always be competing against a number of (perhaps more deserving) students for the same job. Make sure you make the best of your time at UCSD, both academically and otherwise, so that you have something to show for yourself once companies come knocking at the university door.

</string>
    <string name="uni21_6">Although it is a common consensus that there isn’t much that is beautiful about students of UCSD, it doesn’t mean that they aren’t fun. There are a lot of wild parties happening in San Diego all the time and Tijuana is one of the wackiest and craziest places to be. So while you might be a tad bit disappointed with the quality (and perhaps quantity) of girls within the university, rest assured that there’s much more to look forward to once you’re outside.
</string>
    <string name="uni21_7">While the University of California certainly has better institutes, UCSD is by no means the least of them. Excellent institute, and placements to match.

</string>


    <string name="uni22_1">The University of Minnesota, Twin Cities (U of M) is a public research university located in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, United States. It is the oldest and largest campus within the University of Minnesota system and has the fourth-largest student body in the United States, in terms of numbers. It’s also a fantastic university, which is quite clear when you consider how hard it is to get into it.

</string>
    <string name="uni22_2">The magnificent campus of the University of Minnesota is spread over roughly 2700 acres of land. Though it is a pretty old school, constant rebuilding and renovation means that all the buildings are architecturally and technologically up to date. The campus is state of the art, with well maintained classrooms and athletic facilities which would put many Olympic stadiums to shame. They have a fantastic library system, which has over 3 million volumes in all. There is excellent sports infrastructure for students which include all sorts of grounds and recreational facilities.

</string>
    <string name="uni22_3">Where University of Minnesota lacks in location and weather, it more than makes up in terms of academics. It’s one of the toughest universities to get into for a reason, and that reason is probably the fact that it has some of the finest professors in the country. Students manage to maintain excellent rapports with their teachers, but the one thing they might take some time to get used to is the large sizes of most classes. Individual attention is nearly impossible in a class of about 200 students, but professors still take out time for students if they go to them during office hours with doubts.

</string>
    <string name="uni22_4">This is where a major problem lies. But honestly, if you make it to U of M, funding should be the last thing on your mind. It’s terribly difficult to get, but fortunately the fee isn’t too high.

</string>
    <string name="uni22_5">Now, this highly depends on the course you’re pursuing. U of M is very highly regarded for Electrical Engineering, which is why the jobs and internships you get in these fields are absolutely fantastic. Even for other courses, jobs are pretty good, though they might not come too easily. There are multiple career fairs, though, so it’s all about being good enough to prove yourself.

</string>
    <string name="uni22_6">Since University of Minnesota is such a huge university, it’s tremendously easy to find people who you’ll get along with. There are a number of schools in the campus, and there’s ample time to get familiar with a variety of people. You’ll find a good mix of students here, though the Asian population would outweigh the others by a margin in most Graduate programs.
</string>
    <string name="uni22_7">Definitely one of the best universities for Electrical Engineering, and not too far behind when it comes to the other courses as well. The weather is a HUGE minus point though, so you better be sure before you take a leap of faith.

</string>


    <string name="uni23_1">Syracuse University is a private research university that was founded in 1870. SU is one of the universities that almost every average Indian student would apply to, and probably one that students can place in the ‘Safe’ category (which means that you’ll hopefully have Syracuse to fall back on if absolutely nothing else works out for you). Of course, those are just statistics, and one shouldn’t judge a university purely based on the number of applications it accepts. Syracuse is definitely one of the better universities around, thanks in no small amount to its location in the state of New York. Speaking of which…

</string>
    <string name="uni23_2">What really strikes you about Syracuse University is the diversity of buildings – while some look like they’ve been flown down from Scotland, others give the ultra-modern look of Tokyo. The beautiful 200 acre campus is complete with two state-of-the-art study centers, and eight excellent libraries. The libraries together have over 2.5 million volumes, covering a range of all possible subjects. The university also offers world class facilities for anyone interested in pursuing any kind of sport. Panasci Lounge is one of the places that you’ll find a large population of students at any given time of the day.

</string>
    <string name="uni23_3">Well, the faculty is pretty good. Professors are highly qualified (of course) and have the added bonus of being extremely approachable. They go out of their way to help students whenever need be.
</string>
    <string name="uni23_4">It’s not difficult to get scholarships, thankfully. So you can take a deep breath and relax now. Research Assistantships and Teaching Assistantships are also pretty easily available.

</string>
    <string name="uni23_5">Since Syracuse is one of the better colleges around, it certainly shouldn’t be a problem getting a pretty-high-paying job once you’re here. Where you get placed naturally depends on the course you’re doing, but more often than not, you can expect to get picked up by one of the top players.

</string>
    <string name="uni23_6">Syracuse is a tiny little town, with not much to do both inside and outside the campus. Of course, that in no way means that the place is dead. There are hundreds of house parties going on throughout the week, in apartments and dorms as well. When they do get out once in a while, students normally hang out at Armory Square or Marshall Street. And you always have Downtown Syracuse, where you have something for everyone. Some of the places one should definitely check out are Dinosaur Bar-b-Que, Acropolis Pizza House, The Pita Pit, Tully’s Good Times, etc.

</string>
    <string name="uni23_7">Aim for the stars, you might reach the sky. Syracuse is perhaps slightly below the proverbial sky, even though it’s an excellent university. Should be a good bet if you have an average or slightly below-average profile.

</string>


    <string name="uni24_1">The University of California – Irvine is a public research university located, as the name quite clearly gives away, in Irvine, California. Founded in 1965, it’s a relatively new university but has very quickly climbed up the rankings and is definitely among the Tier 1 universities, which should explain its rating as a Public Ivy League. The excellent research program, coupled with the location and doors it opens for you, means that it’s a hot favourite for students from all over the world. Pity it’s not terribly easy to get into, but it’s not extremely hard either.

</string>
    <string name="uni24_2">Well, most campuses that are a few hundred years old are exceptionally good, so imagine how brilliant a newly made university would be. The beautiful 1489 acre campus has everything students could ask for; the state-of-the-art lecture halls, research centers and libraries are complemented sweetly by the fantastic recreation centers and athletic facilities. They have a couple of bars on campus itself, and some excellent coffee shops too; heck, there’s even a gaming zone.

</string>
    <string name="uni24_3">UCI takes immense pride in the fact that a number of their professors are Nobel Prize winners, and are pioneers in their respective fields. Learning here is an absolute joy, but sometimes academics may suffer a bit due to the lack of one-to-one attention. That too is gettable, but you have to take the initiative yourself and approach the professor; it isn’t preschool.

</string>
    <string name="uni24_4">Since UCI is a public university, it isn’t impossible to get scholarships or freeships, but they’re normally need-based, and also performance dependant. Indian students do normally get scholarships of a few thousands, but don’t count on it.

</string>
    <string name="uni24_5">UCI is known for the excellent opportunities that open up for students who graduate from here, and this is vindicated by the kind of jobs students are offered. If you keep in touch with your Career Center, and start lapping up all internships that may come your way, it will go a long way in ensuring that you have enough contacts to help you out when the time comes for you to apply for a job.

</string>
    <string name="uni24_6">You’ll find a number of Asians (that’s what Americans call people from China) here, but a healthy number of Indians as well. It’s not too bad, though, and overall it’s a nice multicultural mix. The boys opine that the women are extremely hot; pity that the girls can’t say the same about them.
</string>
    <string name="uni24_7">While it admittedly lags behind UC-Berkeley and UCLA, UC-Irvine is definitely among one of the better schools in the USA. And if you’re looking out for a great balance of work and play, your search should stop here.

</string>


    <string name="uni25_1">Rochester Institute of Technology is a private research university started in 1829. RIT’s strategic location – New York – somewhat puts it amongst the better universities around by default. It is arguably one of the favourite among Indians students. The only deterrent would be fees which are on the higher side, but meritorious profiles get good scholarships too.

</string>
    <string name="uni25_2">The RIT campus is spread over a massive 1300 acres with almost 250 buildings in it. The architecture is a gives a typical brick-building look, hence, students fondly call the University a ‘brick-city’. There is only one, but a huge, library by the name ‘Wallace’ which has books of all the possible subjects.

</string>
    <string name="uni25_3">Students are more or less satisfied with the level of education at RIT. The professors are highly knowledgeable and pretty friendly too. Students are surprised, and pleased, by the fact that professors are so approachable in spite of being involved in their own high levels of research.

</string>
    <string name="uni25_4">Despite a private university, RIT does shower you with a lot of grants and scholarships at the time of admissions (around $8,000 per semester) to fund your education. You can take up Teaching Assistantships and Research Assistantships, which should go some way in helping you out financially.

</string>
    <string name="uni25_5">Well, the placements are decent, though nothing out of the world. Major recruiters are IBM and Microsoft, but that’s the case almost everywhere.

</string>
    <string name="uni25_6">The crowd at RIT is surprisingly multicultural, given the plethora of Indians applying to it. This is perhaps because of the fact that most Indians who secure better universities tend to join them. You would find a nice mix of students from different cultural and socio-economic backgrounds. You’ll also find at least a few students who share your interests, or just about any interest in the world.
</string>
    <string name="uni25_7">With time the university has attracted good talent and with rising competition, getting in isn\'t terribly easy. This should definitely be on your list if you have a decent profile.

</string>


    <string name="uni26_1">Although most students would fail to identify with it, the real name of ‘VirginiaTech’ is Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. It’s a public ‘land-grant’ university in Blacksburg, Virginia, and has been one of the top universities in the country ever since its inauguration in 1872. VirginiaTech is one of the most sought after colleges around, especially for students pursuing a Masters in branches like Mechanical, Civil, and Aerospace Engineering. Getting in is extremely difficult though – every year the average undergrad GPA increases, and the number of applications shoots up some more.

</string>
    <string name="uni26_2">The beautiful campus is spread across 2600 acres of land. From the outside, VirginiaTech can tend to look quite antique. In a good way, of course. Many of the buildings at the institute look like massive, imposing castles and you’ll often find students being quite overwhelmed by them on day one itself. From the inside, though, the buildings are absolutely state-of-the-art, with world class equipments in brilliantly designed laboratories and lecture halls. The libraries are fantastic as well, containing over 4 million volumes between them.
</string>
    <string name="uni26_3">VirginiaTech is known for its academics, more than anything else. Anyone who knows will tell you that VTech is one of the best institutes in terms of professors and pedagogy. Even though the professors can be slightly hard to approach at times (because research work takes up a major chunk of their time), students vouch that they are nice enough to give you a few minutes if you ever need help.

</string>
    <string name="uni26_4">Being a public university, they tend to be slightly generous with scholarships. But you need to earn them, of course, which means you need to be really really good. Alternatively, you could quite easily get Teaching Assistantships and Research Assistantships.

</string>
    <string name="uni26_5">The career centre is extremely helpful, and most students (especially engineering grads) get placed in impressive companies with excellent job profiles, and packages to match. Not bad, eh?

</string>
    <string name="uni26_6">There’s a surprisingly high number of ‘lookers’ at VirginiaTech, considering that this is a school known mainly for its engineering programs. People are pretty friendly, especially with members of the opposite sex, and it’s perfectly normal to see inter-race and inter-nationality mixing. Although the engineering school is dominated by males (naturally), there are a lot of pretty girls in other courses, and cross-course bonding is quite common, so that’s not really a problem.
</string>
    <string name="uni26_7">An excellent university with a brilliant history, VirginiaTech should be in your top 5 if you plan to do a Masters in Mechanical, Civil or Aerospace Engineering, and just Slightly lower if you plan to do anything else.

</string>


    <string name="uni27_1">University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, is a public research university which was founded in 1817. UMich is very famous for its research work and has one of the largest research expenditures amongst American Universities.
</string>
    <string name="uni27_2">The Ann Arbor campus is spread over 712 acres and is divided into North, Central, South and Medical campuses. All campuses are conveniently connected by bus and shuttles. The college of Engineering is in the North Campus, which also houses an excellent library having over 4 million volumes.

</string>
    <string name="uni27_3">UMich is widely regarded as one of the best institutes in the world for just about any field of study, and it has a faculty to match that reputation. Although many professors are involved in high levels of research, they are more than willing to make time for students who take the initiative and show interest. A number of professors are Nobel laureates, and winners of many academic prizes, so one thing that certainly cannot be doubted is the fantastic quality of education you’ll receive if you end up at Ann Arbor.

</string>
    <string name="uni27_4">Although you’ll be competing with a number of perhaps better students, receiving some sort of scholarship or freeship is not impossible. It’s definitely difficult to get though, which is why many students are involved in Teaching or Research Assistantships.

</string>
    <string name="uni27_5">Well, they’re excellent. What else do you expect in one of the topmost schools of the world? Some of the largest companies worldwide visit UMich to pick up students in numbers, but one thing you have to realize is that you’ll be facing tremendous competition from fellow students – don’t let the ‘small fish, big pond’ feeling overwhelm you.

</string>
    <string name="uni27_6">Life here is a good mix of everything. Some prefer house parties while some drop in to a bar. Non-alcoholics, too, enjoy their time in UMich by getting involved in various phenomenal cultural activities like music and movies. The crowd is VERY serious when it comes to studies but they equally manage their social lives.
</string>
    <string name="uni27_7">Well, it’s going to be a huge ask to get in anyway, so if you do, and you think you can tolerate the awful weather, there’s absolutely nothing that should stop you from going there.

</string>


    <string name="uni28_1">University of Illinois – Urbana Champaign is a public research university, started in 1859. Because of its glorious history and excellent opportunity, it is widely regarded as the best public university in the States. That was the good news. The bad news is that it’s awfully hard to get into UIUC, and next to impossible for Indians, unless they have fantastic profiles. No no no, it’s not racism. It’s just that, well, people tend to have better profiles than the average Indian.

</string>
    <string name="uni28_2">The beautiful UIUC campus is built on a sprawling 1468 acre stretch of land. Known for its landscape and architecture, the campus is described my many as a ‘work of art’. In fact, this is one of very few universities the world over to have its very own airport. YES! It has an airport!
</string>
    <string name="uni28_3">If a professor is teaching at UIUC, it’s probably because he’s that good. While there’s absolutely no questioning the ability and class of the faculty at such massive institutions, students sometimes question their dedication to teaching. But at UIUC, most professors are pretty friendly and more-than-willing to help out, even in non- office hours.
</string>
    <string name="uni28_4">Being a public university, UIUC isn’t too expensive - $29,000 per year would seem like pocket change a few years down the line. While getting direct financial aid is near-impossible, other grants like Research Assistantships and Teaching Assistantships are sometimes more obtainable, but they certainly shouldn\'t be taken for granted.

</string>
    <string name="uni28_5">Some of the best possible job profiles (and the fantastic salaries that come with them) are always on offer at UIUC. If you’re graduating from here, you’re pretty bloody good; companies recognize that and reward you accordingly. In short, you’re more or less sorted once you’re here.

</string>
    <string name="uni28_6">In spite of the college being situated in what can more or less be called a village, both Urbana and Champaign have their respective ‘downtowns’ where students often hang out. Students can be found partying/clubbing in areas like Daniel Street, Downtown Champaign and Green Street. Station 211, Radio Maria, Mandarin Wok, Murphy’s Pub and High Dive are some of the more frequented joints in the region. For all you desperate-for-home-food Indians, there’s a nice little place called Bombay Grill as well.

</string>
    <string name="uni28_7">In spite of the pathetic weather, UIUC is consistently ranked in the top ten for almost every single program under the sun. In a nutshell, if you make it, you should probably take it.

</string>

    <string name="uni29_1">State University of New York - Stony Brook is a public research university started in 1957. Also known as Stony Brook University, it is one of the highly reputed public schools in the USA. This is probably one of the reasons why it’s a hot favourite among Asians, especially Indians. Of course, the more obvious reasons for Indians are also as straightforward –
</string>
    <string name="uni29_2">SUNY – Stony Brook is built across three campuses, viz: East, West and South. The campus is spread over a massive 1100 acres, and still manages to be really beautiful. There are two main libraries where more than a million volumes are available. The University Café, which is a bar, is located inside the campus, along with a few cafeterias namely Roth Café, Kelly Café and Tea House, Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks.

</string>
    <string name="uni29_3">The faculty at Stony Brook University is quite knowledgeable. Most of the professors work in their respective fields and hence are aware of many new ideas and innovations. Majority of the teachers use Flash and PowerPoint, thus making the entire lecture session dynamic and live! Moreover, the professors are quite flexible and approachable. They go out of their way to help students even after the college hours.

</string>
    <string name="uni29_4">That being said, the university is still nice enough to dish out a few need-based scholarships. Plus, you can always obtain Teaching Assistantships or Research Assistantships at Stony Brook. How very nice of them.

</string>
    <string name="uni29_5">Since Stony Brook is certainly among the better universities around, getting a good, well-paying job should never really be an issue. What you should ask yourself is ‘what kind of job do I want?’, and then choose your subjects, and your academic ambitions, accordingly.

</string>
    <string name="uni29_6">If you’re studying at Stony Brook, then the place to be when you’re free is definitely Three Village, where you find urban and upper middle class crowd. There are also two nice beaches not too far from the campus- Stony Brook Beach and West Meadow Beach.
</string>
    <string name="uni29_7">While the university is excellent, don’t be fooled into thinking you’re going to be in the middle of everything that’s awesome about New York. This isn’t NYC, sunshine, and it certainly isn’t Manhattan; Stony Brook is far far away from any of that, and if that’s what you come here for, you’ll soon realize you’re in the middle of nowhere.

</string>

    <string name="uni30_1">University of California – Los Angeles is a public research university founded in 1919. It’s amongst the top universities in the USA, and is a hot favourite among Asians (specially Indians) although it should be noted that it’s not easy to get in at all.
</string>
    <string name="uni30_2">The UCLA campus is stretched over about 420 acres and consists of 163 magnificent buildings. The campus is full of both natural and man-made beauty, with gardens, fountains and museums. The library system has over 8 million volumes, distributed nicely in a number of buildings. The university is also known for its research, and accordingly has fantastic research facilities and laboratories.

</string>
    <string name="uni30_3">The faculty here is certainly excellent. While it would perhaps be an exaggeration to say that professors are extra keen, they are definitely willing to go out of the way for enthusiastic students. Most of the professors are highly knowledgeable, having funny-sounding degrees from prestigious institutes over the world. While their busy schedules may, at times, be slightly frustrating, it can’t be doubted that it’s an absolute joy to study under such prodigies.

</string>
    <string name="uni30_4">Historically, UCLA is rather generous with its scholarships, but you have to be extremely deserving. It\'s really difficult to get a research assistantship (known as "Graduate Student Researcher" position here), especially in Electrical Engineering.

</string>
    <string name="uni30_5">Since UCLA is one of the better colleges around, it certainly shouldn’t be a problem getting a pretty-high-paying job once you’re here. Where you get placed naturally depends on the course you’re doing, but more often than not, you can expect to get picked up by one of the top players in whatever field you’re specializing in.

</string>
    <string name="uni30_6">Well, it’s Los Angeles. The home of Hollywood has millions of things to offer for students of all sorts of backgrounds, interests, shapes and sizes. Even if you’re the introverted type who doesn’t particularly like going out much, the crowd at the university is, in a word, excellent. Having said that, it won’t take long for you to realize that the volume of life outside campus is much higher, which simply means that you’re going to have a hell of a time once you’re out in LA proper. The bars, the clubs, the restaurants, the women (and the men, to be fair) – perhaps unparalleled anywhere in the world. The most popular areas to visit (if you want to get hooked up, or even otherwise) are Melrose, Santa Monica and Sunset Strip. Then of course you have Universal Studios, which most people agree is the best thing about LA.

</string>
    <string name="uni30_7">Though it’s easy to get sold just by knowing the location, you should bear in mind that it’s a brilliant school as well. One thing you can be sure of is that you would never regret going to UCLA.

</string>

    <string name="uni31_1">Iowa State University is a public research university located in Ames, Iowa. Founded in 1858, the university has consistently been ranked among the Top-50 in the United States for its engineering, science and agricultural programs. It also holds the distinction of being the birthplace of the first ever electronic digital computer. Pretty cool, eh?

</string>
    <string name="uni31_2">For a university that was born as early as 1858, ISU still looks magnificent. Of course, they have constantly revamped the buildings and added newer forms of architecture, and the latest technologies to their research centers, but somehow even the old buildings (which are still the cornerstones of the campus) have weathered a million storms and still come out strong. In a nutshell, the campus is brilliant.

</string>
    <string name="uni31_3">ISU is primarily a school of technology, and so has a host of professors who are pioneers in their respective fields. However, students often complain about the language/accent barrier coming in their way, and the teaching methods not always being up to the mark. But for every student who has ‘issues’, there are at least five others who are thoroughly pleased with the academics at ISU. What we can make out of this is that it’s probably pretty good.

</string>
    <string name="uni31_4">Well you don’t get scholarships too easily. In fact, there’s a very tiny chance that you’ll get one. However, teaching and research based assistantships are available.

</string>
    <string name="uni31_5">Well, ISU hosts a number of career and job fairs, so if you’re in touch with the career center, getting a good, well-paying job should really not be an issue. Some top, top firms like Accenture, Boeing, Cargill, etc hire in numbers from here.

</string>
    <string name="uni31_6">Thank god for the crowd, really. Unfortunately - or fortunately, if you’re here only to study - the party scene here isn’t exactly the most happening thing in the world. Yes, there are numerous bars and some nice restaurants, but Ames isn’t exactly a big city and never will be. So well, you have to ‘make do’ with your college-mates, but the good news is that the crowd at ISU is pretty top quality. You can find a number of people to match your interests, your likes, dislikes, even your sexual preferences. All in all, it’s not NYC, but it’s really not too bad.

</string>
    <string name="uni31_7">Although Iowa State University may be categorized under \'ambitious\' if you have an average profile, you\'d had better make sure you\'re up to the weather before you land up here.

</string>

    <string name="uni32_1">Michigan State University (MSU) is a public flagship research university started in the year 1855. It is also considered one of the best Public Ivy Leagues. MSU is well renowned for a variety of courses across all fields and specifically in engineering, the Mechanical department and Telecommunications program are highly rated by experts unanimously. Michigan being the automobile hub, this university is extremely popular amongst student who are looking for Masters/PhD in Mechanical and/or Automobile Engineering.

</string>
    <string name="uni32_2">The Michigan State University campus is one of the largest in the states and spreads over 5,200 acres (Yes, you read it right). There are two major campus sub-divisions, i.e. North and South. The main library is spread over multiple locations with over 5 million books cumulatively. There are numerous other libraries dedicated to engineering, mathematics and law separately. The Student Union is the hub of all activities within the campus.

</string>
    <string name="uni32_3">The professors at MSU are highly rated for their knowledge and interest in class and engaging students in general. There are variety of courses offered with a lot of technology integrated into the pedagogy. The curriculum of the Applied Engineering Sciences deserves a special mention for being very flexible. Most professors of MSU are greatly involved in research and are champions in their own field.

</string>
    <string name="uni32_4">MSU being a public research university, the chances of obtaining some financial aid or fellowship is high. A student who has a good academic and extra-curricular track record will surely be benefitted here a good deal. Expecting some sort of an aid at the time of admission may be difficult but prospects during the course have been rated extremely high.

</string>
    <string name="uni32_5">Michigan State University organises numerous career fairs and has an active networking portal for recruiters to interact with students. The concept of internship is highly promoted here. Off-campus Michigan won’t be such a bad place to seek employment especially for those involved in the mechanical and automotive industry. Also, the moderate living expenses in comparison to the East and West coast followed by a good industrial hub - Detroit, makes MSU pretty popular amongst the student coomunity.

</string>
    <string name="uni32_6">The campus of MSU is supposedly very active with numerous activities keeping the social circuit going. Students are extroverts in general and this place is often rated as the "party hub". Students love the nightlife in Michigan with a lot of off-campus options. Be it a disco, pub or a house party, there’s always something cooking at MSU. For the foodies here, we will point out that there exists this online portal through which grub from 20 odd restaurants can be ordered right to your doorstep.

</string>
    <string name="uni32_7">Michgian State University is definitely one of the very good universities of the States in terms of course, teaching and overall reputation. Unfortunately, the university is over-shadowed by its elder sister University of Michigan Ann Arbor. However, we feel that MSU will surely do you a world of good. Keep it as a moderate to safe option if you\'ve a fantastic profile, and for those aiming at an MS in Mechanical should explore MSU very seriously.

</string>

    <string name="uni33_1">Established in 1927, University of Houston (UH) is a state research university and the flagship institution of the University of Houston System. It is 3rd largest university in Texas in terms of enrollment which has a count up to 43,000. According to the U.S. News &amp;amp;amp; World Report the university is on the No. 187 in its National University Rankings, and No. 105 among top public universities.

</string>
    <string name="uni33_2">The campus stands on the total area of 667 acres and it is spacious with respect to Houston’s urban content. The university campus includes numerous green spaces, fountains, and sculptures, including a work by famed sculptor Jim Sanborn. Renowned architects César Pelli and Philip Johnson have designed buildings on the UH campus. The campus buildings are beautifully constructed and have a good sense of architecture it.

</string>
    <string name="uni33_3">There are various pros and cons in case of this particular topic of faculty. It is difficult to judge whether a faculty is good or no. Faculty at UH is well educated and experienced but, they mostly end up competing each other. Faculty lacks the sense of togetherness among each other and tends towards not responding the students. There have been cases that faculty has being rude to their students.

</string>
    <string name="uni33_4">The university has a different section for the financial aid and provides helps to those who cannot afford the fees. There have been cases recorded that the university has denied students from taking benefits of these facilities and have been rude to them. There is a possibility that the university might reject your application of financial aid due to circumstances or your failure of providing data, but it depends on the situation.

</string>
    <string name="uni33_5">Within Houston the university has developed a lot of contacts. There are firms who recruit students from UH every year. These firms are most times new and students prefer something which has its own name. Most times students deny applying for the placements and search for a job themselves.

</string>
    <string name="uni33_6">Even though the city is considered as the safest in Texas, the campus does not provide the same review. There have neem thievery cases within campus during nights. The campus security seems a little loose and the students have to take care of their belongings themselves. It is difficult to live with such thought in mind, but eventually you deal with it. Else the campus is calmer and has a lot of space apart from buildings. It gives a sense of privacy and makes one feel the best after studying for long hours.

</string>
    <string name="uni33_7">The conclusion is rather simple than you think, if you are a person of architecture then this school has kept the wisdom for you. But if you do not have problems dealing with the fear of burglars then living on campus won’t be a problem too. It is difficult to judge a locality without experiencing it, so if you are a Lego fan and love building things then this college can be the place for you. But, the administration is headache and trusting them over getting you in to the university can be a mistake. Take your chances if you find it affordable because as per the locality the university does not sound cheap.

</string>

    <string name="uni34_1">The University of Massachusetts at Amherst is a public research university, and is the flagship university of the UMass system. It’s also the largest public university in New England (which is a region in northwestern corner of USA comprising of 6 states). It’s a quite highly rated university, and its program in Computer Engineering is to die (or kill) for, which is why most Computer students aim for it. Very few from India get in, though. Tsk tsk.

</string>
    <string name="uni34_2">The least that can be said about the UMass campus is that it’s extremely well designed. A bird’s eye view of the lovely 1450 acre campus would show you a series of concentric rings, with the academic buildings and research labs in the center, followed by residential areas, athletic facilities and parking lots, in that order. Needless to say, all the labs, classrooms and recreational centers are top rate, with all kinds of modern facilities that students may need. The library system is pretty fantastic too, and the main library – the WEB Du Bois Library – is the tallest library in the United States, with 26 stories. Wow. Mind blowing.

</string>
    <string name="uni34_3">A lot of emphasis at UMass is given to general learning which, most students agree, is a good thing. So while you’re excelling at your specialization, you also learn a lot of other pertinent things which would prepare you for the outside world. A lot of the credit for the students’ enthusiasm must go to the professors, who are very approachable and are always willing to go out of their way to help. Oh and they’re bloody good at what they do too.

</string>
    <string name="uni34_4">Since it’s a public university, UMass does dole out scholarships once in a while, but they aren’t terribly easy to get. However, if you manage to maintain a decent GPA, it shouldn’t be impossible. And you always have TAs and RAs to keep your head above water, of course.

</string>
    <string name="uni34_5">Where you get placed depends a lot on what course you’re doing. If you’re a Comps student, you can be sure to get a rather fantastic job. If you’re doing another course, you can be sure to get a job, a good one too, but maybe not that fantastic. Either way, the job you land up with has a lot to do with your performance in class, so make sure it’s up to the mark.

</string>
    <string name="uni34_6">There are a number of places students hang out at, ranging from their dorms all the way to NYC. The middle path would be to chill at one of the many bars in Amherst, which are quite good for a small town. That being said, clubs are few and far between, and aren’t terribly popular anyway. So if you’re looking for a good night, you’d rather try making a few friends first and getting invited to one of the many private parties.

</string>
    <string name="uni34_7">Not exactly Mecca for Computer students, but almost that. Plus, UMass has an undeniable geographical advantage.

  //  <string name="uni35_1">Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey-New Brunswick is a public institution that was founded in 1766. Covering an area of 2688 acres, the New Brunswick Campus (or Rutgers–New Brunswick) is the largest campus of Rutgers. It is the site of the original Rutgers College. It further comprises 5 smaller campuses and a few buildings in downtown New Brunswick. Among its many graduate offerings, Rutgers has a highly ranked Graduate School of Education.

</string>
    <string name="uni35_2">At Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey--New Brunswick, 55.6 percent of full-time undergraduates receive some kind of need-based financial aid and the average need-based scholarship or grant award is $12,431.

</string>
    <string name="uni35_3">Each campus has a unique setting and identity, from the hip student feel of the College Avenue campus to the farmland and science buildings at Cook Campus. Each mini-campus has its own student center and dining options. There are more than 400 student clubs and organizations across the mini-campuses, including more than 80 fraternities and sororities. The Rutgers Scarlet Knights compete in the NCAA Division I Big Ten Conference.

    <string name="uni36_1">University of Cincinnati is a public research university located in, as the name suggests, in Cincinnati. Founded in 1819, it is one of the largest universities in the United States in terms of student intake. Although it does not receive a terribly high number of applications compared to other Indian-favourite schools, University of Cincinnati is extremely renowned for some of its programs, especially aeronautical engineering. And fortunately for you, it isn’t too hard to get in, it isn’t frightfully expensive, and they even give out lovely scholarships.

</string>
    <string name="uni36_2">The Cincinnati campus is one of the most popular in the country. Built on a sprawling 473 acres of land, the campus is renowned for its architectural brilliance, which is probably a direct result of the fact that some award-winning architects were hired to design it. It’s clear that a lot of attention was paid to detail, and efforts were made to make the university look like, well, a university. While everything is absolutely state-of-the-art from the inside, the buildings look palatial from the outside. The engineering building is designed to look like a four cylinder engine! The libraries are well-maintained and well-stocked, having over 2 million volumes covering a number of subjects. Research centers are brilliantly designed and pretty safe too. All in all, it’s a pleasure to be on campus.

</string>
    <string name="uni36_3">Now, the faculty on the whole is pretty excellent, but of course there are positives and negatives, which normally depend largely on the stream you choose. But the one thing that cannot be debated is that the professors at Cincinnati are knowledgeable, well-versed, easily approachable and extremely passionate about their teaching, which is all that really matters, isn’t it? Students single out the Aeronautical engineering faculty for extra praise, but that in no way means that professors from other branches are not equally excellent.

</string>
    <string name="uni36_4">Another plus point about UC is that it gives out excellent financial aid to its students. Scholarships of up to $10,000 a year are given out generously.

</string>
    <string name="uni36_5">The placements at Cincinnati are pretty good, especially if you\'re doing a rather \'core\' course such as Mechanical or Aerospace engineering. A massive Boeing production unit is right next door, so there shouldn\'t be much trouble getting a good, well-paying job if you deserve it.

</string>
    <string name="uni36_6">People normally associate University of Cincinnati with a pretty good crowd. And when we say that, we mean both ‘pretty’ and ‘good’. You’ll definitely find a number of lookers on campus, and if you don’t, then there’s the whole of Cincinnati to explore. If you’re Indian, you ought to know that, for a change, you won’t be overwhelmed, or get what they call a ‘culture shock’ here. You’ll also be pleased to know that most people (including the pretty girls) are quite friendly, and easy to get along with.
</string>
    <string name="uni36_7">Definitely a good option if you’re looking for a big college in a big city, and one of the top schools for aerospace engineering.

</string>

    <string name="uni37_1">The University of Colorado at Boulder is a public research university. Started in 1876, it is one of the most popular public universities and the telecomm program it offers is probably the oldest and definitely the finest in the world! It is especially popular among Asians.

</string>
    <string name="uni37_2">The Colorado campus is massive. It’s spread over 786 acres and houses over 20,000 students. The infrastructure is very impressive, especially the engineering centre which is home to the nation’s largest geo technical centrifuge. The library is fantastic and you can get an idea of the number of books by the simple fact that the library had to be shifted to a new building because the weight of the books was causing physical damage to the floor. There are also world class facilities for sports and recreation which are available seven days a week.

</string>
    <string name="uni37_3">The faculty at Boulder is highly renowned, especially the telecom faculty. The faculty includes a number of Nobel laureates and most of the professors are PhDs\'. Students say that the professors are extremely approachable and friendly in spite of being heavily involved in high levels of research activities.

</string>
    <string name="uni37_4">65-70% of the students get need based scholarship at Colorado Boulder. The scholarship is usually around $4000 per semester at the time of joining.

</string>
    <string name="uni37_5">It shouldn’t normally be a problem getting a good, well-paying job, especially if you happen to be doing the telecommunications course, in which case you can be sure of being picked up by one of the top players at a fantastic salary.

</string>
    <string name="uni37_6">At Boulder, there are a number of things to do and the scenic beauty makes almost everything enjoyable. It’s common for students to indulge in Bike Activities and other such ‘Green’ activities. In fact, Boulder is known for its environmentally acceptable life. A Colorado Boulder alumni even said, ‘You don’t need drugs and alcohol to get high at Boulder’. Some of the common hangouts for Boulderites are The Sink, The Foundry, Bacaro, Deli Zone, Cosomo’s Pizza, Thunderbird and Attic Bar &amp;amp;amp; Bistro. Denny’s and Denver Diner are the 24*7 restaurants.

</string>
    <string name="uni37_7">Good college, great atmosphere. It may not be love at first sight if you’re used to a big city, but common sense and the irresistible force of nature will prevail soon. Oh and it’s Mecca for you if you’re a Telecom student.

</string>

    <string name="uni38_1">The Fu Foundation School of Engineering of the Columbia University is a private research institute started in 1896. The fifth-oldest university in the United States, CU has achieved Ivy League status thanks to its standing amongst the elite. It is one of the more sought-after schools around, but it isn’t impossible to get in, provided your academics are more-than-decent, and you’ve done a fair share of some kind of research work.

</string>
    <string name="uni38_2">There are 20 major libraries in the Columbia University campus. There is the popular Blue Java Coffee Bar on campus as well.

</string>
    <string name="uni38_3">Now, the faculty is excellent, as you would probably expect in one of the best colleges in the world, which is located in one of the best cities in the world. But with such excellence comes a sense of expectation out of others. Students are often berated a bit if they aren’t able to live up to professors expectations, and they would do well not to get into the bad books of the rather egoistic professors. But having said that, if students are sincere and committed, getting along with faculty members becomes quite a cakewalk.

</string>
    <string name="uni38_4">Since it’s a private institute, and a highly reputed one for that, scholarships are almost impossible to get. Students may apply for Teaching Assistantships though.

</string>
    <string name="uni38_5">This is something you really shouldn’t be worrying about. You’ll definitely get a job, and a pretty good one, too. The fees you pay at Columbia seems like pocket change once you get yourself placed.

</string>
    <string name="uni38_6">You see a very diverse crowd at Columbia University, though you’ll notice that most students come from pretty strong financial backgrounds. There isn’t exactly too much of a ‘campus life’, so to speak, but this is because of the university’s location in the heart of NYC. Most students aren’t involved in sports or other college-level activities, and there’s hardly any ‘Greek Life’ at Columbia. But this is no way means that life is boring. Oh no. Not at all. On the contrary, there isn’t ever a moment of boredom, because of the PLETHORA of bars, restaurants, theaters, coffee shops, and just about anything else in Manhattan.
</string>
    <string name="uni38_7">If you can afford it, go right ahead. You won’t regret it, we promise.

</string>

    <string name="uni39_1">New Jersey Institute of Technology is a public research university located in Newark, New Jersey. Founded in 1881, NJIT can easily be classified under the ‘Safe’ category for most, which explains why it gets a plethora of applications from Indians. That being said, the college is really helped by its ideal location, which is a reason students may choose it over academically better-renowned institutes.

</string>
    <string name="uni39_2">NJIT is built over 45 beautiful acres of land in the University Heights area of Newark. Though the facilities available here for students may not be as amazing as some other universities, Indians really shouldn’t be worried, because it’ll definitely be more than anything you’ve ever come across all your life. The library is well-stocked, with over a million volumes covering anything you may need, and the research laboratories are pretty ‘functional’ as well.

</string>
    <string name="uni39_3">Now, if you don’t have a great profile, and not many signs of it changing much, it’s slightly unreasonable to expect them to be sponsoring you, isn’t it? Specially when getting in is so darn easy.

</string>
    <string name="uni39_4">Well, let’s be frank. NJIT isn’t the best school in the world. You can’t hope for extraordinary placements. In fact, their career fairs aren’t highly participated in. Simply put, getting a job while you’re still at college isn’t a given, but it’s pretty easy once you’re out, thanks to NJIT’s excellent location.

</string>
    <string name="uni39_5">Fortunately, though, New York is RIGHT next door! And, as we’re sure you know by now, NYC is full of all sorts of opportunities. Bars, GayBars, Clubs, StripClubs, Coffee shops, Bakeries… everything in the world is here.

</string>
    <string name="uni39_6">You probably shouldn’t even apply if you have a good profile. If you have a rather poor profile, though, you’d had best apply to NJIT quickly. Beggars can’t really be choosers, we’re afraid.

</string>


    <string name="uni40_1">Clemson University is a public research university located in Clemson in South Carolina. It was started in 1889 and has an overall enrollment of over 20,000 students, a large number of which are part of the engineering and science school. Although it’s a safe university for courses like Computers and Electrical for an above average profile, it’s quite highly recommended for courses that have field related work such as Mechanical and Civil.

</string>
    <string name="uni40_2">The campus is spread over a massive 1700 acres with and its renowned for its scenic beauty. Cooper Library, the main library, covers thousands of volumes of all the possible courses imaginable. Although there isn’t a single bar on campus, there are a number of coffee shops and a very decent theatre as well.

</string>
    <string name="uni40_3">Now, Clemson is no Stanford. While there are undoubtedly some excellent professors, very often you also do come across the not-so-competitive ones. It’s not too bitter a pill to swallow, though, since the one common factor among all professors is their passion towards teaching and their willingness to help any students who need assistance.

</string>
    <string name="uni40_4">As long as your profile impresses them in some way (it normally does), it shouldn’t be too hard to get yourself some kind of scholarship. Research and Teaching Assistantships are always possible to obtain, though, if you miss out on ‘free’ financial aid.

</string>
    <string name="uni40_5">Clemson is a fast improving upcoming school, and the effort it puts into its career centre is testimony to that. Top companies like General Electric, Michelin and Target are regular hirers at the university. Although you’ve to make sure that you’ve to maintain good acads if you want a job.

</string>
    <string name="uni40_6">In the university so massive, it would be silly – almost criminal – to limit yourself just to the engineering buildings and crowds. While the people immediately around you may make you want to pull your hair out, you can be rest assured that you’ll eventually find agreeable company somewhere or another in the school. And you’d had better find something to do and someone to do it with, because you’re going to get pretty bored if you don’t. Downtown Clemson is a lovely, lively place, yes, but it has no clubs and it doesn’t exactly have much nightlife either.

</string>
    <string name="uni40_7">Good college which is slowly climbing up the rankings. If you were to ask us a few years from now, we’d probably say ‘go right ahead and join it’, but since you’re asking us right now, we’re going to say, see if you’ve something better for your profile.

</string>

    <string name="uni41_1">The University of Wisconsin Madison is a public research university, and is the flagship institute of the University of Wisconsin system. Founded in 1848, the school ranks among the top ten for a number of its programs, including many in various forms of engineering. Of course, this also means that it’s quite a big ask for an average human to get in, but if you have a good enough profile, then it’s definitely worth a shot.

</string>
    <string name="uni41_2">The University of Wisconsin – Madison campus is definitely a sight to behold. The main campus is built on about 900 acres, though if you include all other campuses and research centers, the expanse is over 10,000 acres. The scenic beauty all over the campus is absolutely spellbinding, with a couple of rivers bordering it on two sides, and the Capital building on a third. Don’t be fooled by the natural beauty; from the inside, the buildings are completely state-of-the-art, having all sorts of sophisticated interiors and equipment. They have some excellent libraries, which together hold over 6 million volumes, and are perhaps the most expansive areas on campus.

</string>
    <string name="uni41_3">There are universities known for their party life, there are some known for their athletics, and some more known for their campuses, but the University of Wisconsin at Madison has earned itself a fantastic reputation thanks primarily to its academic programs. With some highly learned, reputed and dedicated professors, learning really is a joyful experience here. Although personalized attention isn’t a given, considering the size of some classes, professors are more than willing to go out of their way to help, provided it’s the students who take the initiative.

</string>
    <string name="uni41_4">Like is the case with most other public universities, it’s completely possible to get scholarships at UW. However, when you take a look around and see the kind of quality you’re competing with, and you might realize that you’d rather just apply for some Teaching or Research Assistantship and work for the money.

</string>
    <string name="uni41_5">Some fantastic companies like Philips Morrison, Accenture, P&amp;amp;amp;G, Deloitte and Kohls are regular recruiters at UW, and the packages on offer more than do justice to the jobs they give you. As long as you’re able to maintain a decent level of academics, you should be quite sorted when it comes to getting a good, high-paying job.

</string>
    <string name="uni41_6">The one thing that would surprise you (albeit pleasantly) at Wisconsin is the friendliness of everyone. Most students are extremely agreeable, and instantly make you feel at home. Even the hottest girl probably wouldn’t have too much of an attitude problem, which is a good thing if you ask us. Of course, it’s entirely possible to find a wide range of people at UW. The cultural, geographical and socio-economical diversity is really something that the university takes pride in, and it’s quite evident why.

    <string name="uni42_1">University of Pennsylvania was founded in the year 1740 by Benjamin Franklin (yes, you read that right. 1740! Benjamin Franklin!) and is one of the few prestigious Ivy League schools around. UPenn, as it’s called, has the nation’s first medical school and also the world’s first business school – the very famous Wharton. The MS programs at the university are very popular among Asians, especially Indians. UPenn is ranked amongst the finest ‘Comprehensive Universities’ in the world, because it is one of the few universities which you can almost never go wrong with, regardless of the course you’re doing – it’s good for everything. Note that UPenn is a private university and has nothing to do with Penn State University.

</string>
    <string name="uni42_2">There are a number of museums, art galleries, theatres, restaurants, bars and historic sights in and around the campus. The campus houses 15 splendid libraries, which together have a total of about 6 million libraries. They also have a digital library, of course. There are ample facilities for sports and recreation as well, all of which are absolutely first grade, naturally.

</string>
    <string name="uni42_3">University of Pennsylvania is one of the top five research universities in the US, and it owes a lot of this fame to its excellent faculty. UPenn tops the spending list amongst the top universities, which explains why they are able to attract some of the best academicians and research teams. There are a total of about 2100 faculty members in the engineering department alone, which gives a very healthy student/faculty ratio. A lot of importance is given to research as well.

</string>
    <string name="uni42_4">Since UPenn is an Ivy League private school, it’s really really difficult to get any kind of financial aid. Most students don’t, although need-based financial aid is granted in some special cases.

</string>
    <string name="uni42_5">American Management Systems (AMS), JP Morgan Chase, Microsoft, McKinsey, Morgan Stanley, Teach For America are one of the high ranking Multi National Companies that recruit Graduate students at University of Pennsylvania. Oh, you get paid a whopping salary of roughly about $50,000 to $100,000 or more depending on your performance.

</string>
    <string name="uni42_6">If you enjoy partying, Philadelphia is the place to be. As compared to other Ivy League schools, partying is given far more importance at UPenn. Weekend plans are made days in advance.
</string>
    <string name="uni42_7">Definitely one of the better universities around, and certainly one of the most popular amongst Indians, UPenn is really good for almost every course.

</string>


    <string name="uni43_1">If you ever dreamt of being a part of the big city of Los Angeles, learning at California State University, Fullerton is the place to start from. This is a number one university in California and 5th in the country of USA that awards a degree in Hispanics. It has a cultural diversity of 37 % students being Hispanics, 20 % being Asians and 23 % being whites or locals.

</string>
    <string name="uni43_2">CSUF is located on a 236 acre of beautiful landscape. It has everything that can make learning a beautiful and inspiring experience. A Fullerton Arboretum grows everything from beautiful indoor plants to massive forest trees. Tucker Wildlife Sanctuary is a dedication to Benjamin Tucker and his wife Dorothy who had immense love for forest and its native creatures. The Garden Groove centre provides free parking to attending students and has a bookstore to allow students to enjoy learnings, stress free.

</string>
    <string name="uni43_3">CSUF has academically acclaimed professors in various fields of education.Dr. Adam Golub teaches AmricanStudeis that consist of history and the future of America. Dr.PaulStapp teaches biology. Indian professor Binod Tiwari teaches Civil Engineering. Japanese professor DR. Ying ChiaoTsao helps in communication disorders. Famous author and ProfessorDr. Tim Green teaches a degree course in Bilingual- bicultural education.

</string>
    <string name="uni43_4">CSUF has a special financial aid program that allows students to pursue their education without the burden of finances. The financial aid program has multiple models to help students learn at CSUF. The Federal Perkins Loan gives student loans at an interest rate as low as 5%. This loan also gives the flexibility to collect funds and begin paying after loan application and approval process post 9 months. There are many flexible scholarship programs that allows a deserving student to enjoy learning at CSUF free of cost.

</string>
    <string name="uni43_5">CSUF has a reputed list of who’s who in the industry that have studied and provide mentoring to students from the campus. There are alsoreputed organizations that hosts placements each year for students offering cumbersome salaries to the deserved.

    <string name="uni43_7">A great university with a brilliant landscape. With its wide stream of educational offering, there is a course for all your requirements. The cultural bend allows international students to feel comfortable at the campus. The variety of locations at the campus allows students to get inspired at various zones and learn new things at every step. The vast list of awards and accolades achieved by this university makes it on top of the list for any aspiring student with a thirst to learn.

    <string name="uni44_1">Ohio State University is a public research university located in Columbus, which is, obviously, in the state of Ohio. Founded in 1873, OSU is the third largest university campus in the United States of America. OSU is considered one of the better universities when it comes to Computer Engineering and also Networking.

</string>
    <string name="uni44_2">Ohio State University is built on a massive 1764 acre campus, and the architecture is a quite wonderful mix of traditional, modern and post-modern styles. At OSU, you’ll see some brilliantly designed buildings with interiors to match. The library system has over 5 million volumes, and more than 20,000 are added every year. The research centers and lecture halls are terrific, and the recreation center really is a sight to marvel at.

</string>
    <string name="uni44_3">Some students aren’t terribly pleased with the way things operate at OSU, since deadlines often change without much notice, and syllabi aren’t always perfectly adhered to (like in Mumbai University, where books are made after the syllabus is released). But this in no way means that the pedagogy is bad; OSU isn’t a top 25 university for nothing. Most of the professors are excellent in every possible way, though there may sometimes be a tiny communication gap, but that too is nothing that can’t be bridged with ease.

</string>
    <string name="uni44_4">Well, not too much. They seem to believe (and rightly so) that the relatively fee is generous enough. However, scholarships aren’t completely impossible to get, provided a - you need it, and b - you deserve it. This can be done by a - not being too rich, and b - keeping your grades high enough.

</string>
    <string name="uni44_5">Placements at OSU are rather good. Top IT firms like IBM and Accenture are regular recruiters. But like anywhere else, you have to be good at what you do in order to deserve a top job.

</string>
    <string name="uni44_6">One thing that you certainly can’t complain of when at OSU is loneliness, or a lack of like-minded people. The sheer size of the university ensures that you can find people (yes, of both sexes) just like yourself, be it in terms of caste/creed/colour or interests. There are more than enough places to hang out and do things you like, both on and off campus, The Oval being one of the most popular bird-watching points, and the, ahem, libraries being some of the most common spots to pick up a date. Of course, when things don’t seem to be going your way at college, you can always run down to Downtown Columbus or Brewery District, both of which are always bustling with nightlife. Typical university life, this.

</string>
    <string name="uni44_7">Excellent option for Computer engineers provided you can stand the weather, of course.

    <string name="uni45_1">Established in 1870 by Edwin Augustus Stevens, Stevens Institute of Technology (SIT) is one of the first coeducational, private universities that was exclusively devoted to the field of mechanical engineering and is one of the most ancient universities in the United States of America. SIT admits over 5000 graduate and undergraduate students from all over the world. It runs 3 national Centers of Excellence as entitled by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Department of Defence. The university is now headed by Dr. Nariman Farvardin who took over the office on July 1st, 2011 and is the seventh president of SIT.

</string>
    <string name="uni45_2">With a 55 acre campus size, SIT has a hilltop campus overlooking the swanky skyline of Manhattan with bright classrooms, a cutting-edge IT and a world-renowned school library. The college focuses on sustainability and it was awarded the STARS ( Sustainability Tracking and Rating System ) Silver ranking by the AASHE ( Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education ). It\'s been named as a ‘Green College\' by the Princeton Review. The infrastructure is built considering the sustainability factors like recycling, energy conservation, and efficiency. It strives to offer top-notch facilities for a top-notch education.
</string>
    <string name="uni45_3">The faculty to student ratio at SIT is 1:10 which is one of the best among the top colleges of the country in comparison to the national average of 14. The university has a lot more full-time teachers as compared to most schools around with over 65 percent of the professors tutoring full time at the university. Stevens Institute of Technology is dedicated to building a robust, long-term pedagogical team which is indicated by it\'s below average reliance on the part-time professors.

</string>
    <string name="uni45_4">Over sixty-four percent of the graduates receive need-based financial aid and the average grant awarded is 12,278 dollars. There are various options of financial aids including the need-based aid known as the Stevens grant which is awarded to those who still need financial help in spite of having all workable sources of scholarships and grants. This is exclusively available for the full-time graduates and their eligibility is re-evaluated every year depending on the yearly FAFSA ( Free Application for Federal Student Aid ) submission and the student\'s financial need. There are also other options of financial aid like TMS plans for the undergraduate, private loans etc.

</string>
    <string name="uni45_5">Awarded for "Best Career Placement" from the Princeton review\'s "2017 colleges that pay you back", SIT\'s highly conformant graduate and undergraduate programs create highly bankable graduates with over 96 percent of the students receiving graduate school acceptances, job offers or achieve other positive results within a short span of six months after graduating. The problem-solving inclination of the university develops the students into dynamic problem-solvers meeting the compelling needs of the industry, society, and business. This is one of the major reasons why the students of Stevens get heavily recruited. Reportedly, over 330 students got recruited last year on campus. A coefficient education program and a flourishing internship gives the students of Stevens a competitive edge in the corporate world. The extremely skilled students of Stevens create dynamic solutions in the present day\'s complex technical environment.

</string>
    <string name="uni45_6">Stevens has a student population of 6359 and an undergraduate population of 2976. The student to Faculty ratio is 10 with a 44 percent admission rate. Hoboken is rated as one of the most traversable places in New Jersey. The town is refreshing as it is pedestrian-friendly and offers options of cafes, parks, boutiques, nightlife, and restaurants. Living on campus at Stevens means that you are just minutes away from campus cafes, eateries, classes, Jr. Athletic and Recreation Center, Health service center and Charles V. Schaefer. Tread down to the Washington Street which is two blocks off campus to find a plethora of shops, restaurants, and a unique nightlife. The icing on the cake is that you\'re just a few minutes away from the bustling city of New York via train, bus or car, connecting the students to Manhattan\'s renowned business and entertainment culture.

</string>
    <string name="uni45_7">With so many top-notch awards and rankings under its belt, Stevens Institute of Technology has left no stone unturned when it comes to being the best at what it does. Be it the infrastructure, education system, research programs, academic planning, sustainable living etc., it strives to strike the right balance between work and fun. This is evident with the statistical figures of the student placements, faculty ratios, sustainable management and a five-year report on its academic progress, which is available on the website.

    <string name="uni46_1">Cornell University is a private research university located in Ithaca, in the state of New York. Founded in 1865, the college is an Ivy League university, and rightly so – Cornell is, without doubt, one of the finest universities in the USA, if not the world. And since it’s one of the finest, it’s also one of the toughest universities to get into. You’ll find thousands of students applying to Cornell hopefully, only to see their applications being rejected. This doesn’t normally dishearten anyone, though – most people expect it, and those who don’t, well, aren’t terribly smart and definitely don’t deserve to get into Cornell anyway.

</string>
    <string name="uni46_2">The Cornell campus is really a sight to behold. Spread over a massive 745 acres, the university consists of over 250 buildings, all designed to perfection and with interiors to match. The campus is divided into the North, Central and West campuses, with most of the academic buildings located in the central campus, while the residential buildings occupying the others. Lecture halls and research centers have all possible facilities and amenities you could think up of, while the recreation centers would probably leave you spellbound. The campus is home to 20 (yes, twenty!) brilliant libraries, which together form the 11th largest academic library in the USA, holding over 8 million volumes. All in all, the campus is quite self-sufficient, with a theater, a number of bars, restaurants, cafes, and even a couple of bowling alleys.

</string>
    <string name="uni46_3">Well you certainly can’t question the quality of professors at Cornell; amongst the faculty are a few Nobel laureates, Rhodes Scholars and Marshall Scholars. So, clearly, all professors are pioneers in their respective fields of study, but they may not exactly be pioneers when it comes to teaching. Although students are more than satisfied with most of their professors, they do complain that a few give more importance to their research than to teaching. That said, it’s up to you to take the initiative and try maintaining a good rapport with their professors; once that’s done, other things start falling into place too.

</string>
    <string name="uni46_4">Since Cornell is a private university, scholarships are few and far between. But you can always apply for part-time on- or off-campus jobs, or get yourself a Research Assistantship or Teaching Assistantship.

</string>
    <string name="uni46_5">Cornell has a rather handy Career Center, and you can rest assured that you’ll get yourself a quite mouth-watering job. Some of the most well-known companies in the world recruit directly from here, and Cornell being Cornell, you know you’re in for a fantastic job, and a payscale to match.

</string>
    <string name="uni46_6">One thing that you can’t expect to see at Cornell is stupid people. Even the prettiest girl would probably be smarter than you are, so you’re going to have to be pretty innovative with your pick-up lines. Though it must be said that while all students are smart, they’re not at all nerdy. Well okay, a few are. But since it’s such a huge university, it’s impossible not to find people you can get along with.
</string>
    <string name="uni46_7">Well, it’s Cornell. If you aren’t too sensitive to bad climate, you should definitely go. Unless you have something better, of course, but that’s rather unlikely.

  //jobs  <string name="uni47_1">University of California, Davis is a public research university located in the college town of Davis. Established in 1905, it is consistently ranked among the top universities in the world. For whatever unknown reasons, though, it gets rather step-brotherly treatment in the field of engineering compared to its Berkeley and Los Angeles counterparts. It is, however, an excellent university, and definitely one that should be given consideration to.

</string>
    <string name="uni47_2">The massive UC Davis campus is spread across about 5000 acres, and is pretty beautiful for the best part of it. The largest campus in the University of California system by a margin, it’s the only one to boast of an airport (yes, an airport!) within campus. It also has its own fire department, and its own nuclear laboratory. As you probably expect by now, the infrastructure is top notch, with excellent libraries, laboratories, classrooms and athletic facilities.

    <string name="uni47_3">The motto of UC Davis reads ‘Let There Be Light’, and the faculty tries its best to ensure this. Ranked amongst the top ten schools in the states constantly, UC Davis isn’t really all that popular for its engineering programs among Indians, but that’s probably thanks to its rather low acceptance rates. But don’t be fooled – it’s a top, top school with absolutely excellent professors.

</string>
    <string name="uni47_4">While it isn’t impossible to get some kind of scholarship, you need to have a rather fantastic profile to even be eligible for them.

</string>
    <string name="uni47_5">The massive school and huge enrolment pretty much ensures that you’ll find more than enough people you can relate to. The excellent weather ensures that you’ll get to see more than enough eye candy wearing pretty agreeable outfits almost throughout the year. Sounds good? It only gets better. The excellent location of the school means that, even if Davis is a small town, you don’t have to travel far to be part of the hustle and bustle of a big city. Sacramento is right next door and has absolutely everything you could ask for – bars, clubs, stadia, museums, you name it. In a nutshell, life at Davis is good.

</string>
    <string name="uni47_6">Would probably have been much higher ranked had it been in another state which didn’t also have Berkeley and LA. In spite of that, it’s a wonderful school, and an even better town.

</string>


    <string name="uni48_1">San Diego State University (SDSU) is a public flagship research university founded in 1897. Being located in California, it has a decisive advantage over other lower rung colleges of the States, so most students in Computer Science (CS), Electrical and all the circuits and chips branches will be having this university among the lower preferences or as most would like to read – \'safe\'.

</string>
    <string name="uni48_2">The campus has beautiful infrastructure on the whole with an ultra-sleek pedestrian bridge, Open Air Theatre, Aztec Bowl stadium and the Malcolm A. Love library which has almost 5,00,000 books. The library has numerous sub-sections dedicated to various fields including an extensive map collection, children’s literature and a “special collection” section. Apart from this major library there are numerous smaller ones also. The college of engineering offers centres of research like combustion research laboratory, energy analysis diagnostics and a few others as well in other disciplines.

</string>
    <string name="uni48_3">To be very honest, the faculty is not over-the-moon like the ones you’ll find in other Californian T-Schools. Some of them are knowledgeable and engaging in their way of conducting lectures but students rate them slightly above average only. There are good chances for students of CS or EE to get projects under the guidance of the faculty since the professors will be having work in tandem with the bigwigs of Silicon Valley.

</string>
    <string name="uni48_4">SDSU being a public university, there is always a chance for TA/RA and other scholarships. Owing to the university in California and that too being a public one, they will be flooded with applications. In case you intend to nail a scholarship then a complete or well-rounded profile is a MUST.

</string>
    <string name="uni48_5">Firstly, understand the fact that you study in CALIFORNIA. You are virtually guaranteed a placement especially if you are in CS, EE or the business courses. Numerous career fairs with other career related services sessions are a part of the culture here.

</string>
    <string name="uni48_6">At SDSU, you are sure to find people who are career-oriented and all fired up to do extremely well in every walk of life. Some of them will be the typical coding, programming type people wanting to hit jackpots in Silicon Valley. Good looking guys and girls are very common in the university.
</string>
    <string name="uni48_7">Definitely not the top university; San Diego State University may hover around top 10 of the state. However, the state in which it is located does matter A LOT. For those intending to do CS or EE, can keep it as a mid-level option and the ones in Mechanical and other core branches can put it a few rungs lower or maybe even give it a pass. This of course is predicated on the basis of how strong your profile is.

    <string name="uni49_1">UC Berkeley is the flagship institute of the University of California. Statistically, Berkeley (as it’s called) is the most consistently well ranked university in the world. It has the highest number of distinguished graduate programs ranked in the top 10 in their fields by the United States National Research Council. As you can probably gauge, it isn’t easy to get into Berkeley, unless you have an untouchable academic track record. And rightly so – some of the achievements at this institute are fantastic. To give you an idea, UC Berkeley and its researchers are associated with 6 chemical elements of the periodic table. Now that’s something, isn’t it?

</string>
    <string name="uni49_2">Although University of California – Berkeley is one of the oldest schools in the world (it was started in 1869), it has constantly evolved over time, and still has one of the best and most modern campuses in the world. The institute is spread over roughly 1200 acres of land, with some fantastic natural sights, and an infrastructure to match its size.
</string>
    <string name="uni49_3">Since its inception, UC Berkeley has been known for providing both ‘classical’ and ‘practical’ education for students. The pedagogy is exceptional, specially the importance given to research. This is why the college has some of the most amazing laboratories you would ever see.
</string>
    <string name="uni49_4">All scholarships (need-based and non-need-based) at Berkeley are academics-dependant. So if you want any kind of assistantship, you’d better keep your grades pretty high.

</string>
    <string name="uni49_5">Well, we’re talking about the 3rd best university in the US of A. Almost everyone is recruited by the world’s well known MNC’s with a mind boggling salary starting from roughly from $60,000.

</string>
    <string name="uni49_6">Like at any other top institute, you can expect a diverse, multicultural environment at UC Berkeley. You’ll find students from different walks of life, hailing from different countries, probably speaking different languages, with one common factor – academic excellence.
</string>
    <string name="uni49_7">Definitely a top-5 college, regardless of what course you want to do. If you’ve managed to maintain an impeccable academic track record, make sure you apply to UC Berkeley.

</string>

    <string name="uni50_1">The University Of South Florida (USF) is an American metropolitan public research university located in Tampa, Florida, US and it is also a member institution of the State University System of Florida. Founded in 1956, USF is the fourth-largest public university in the state of Florida and is home to 14 colleges, offering more than 80 undergraduate majors and more than 130 graduate, specialist, and doctoral-level degree programs. Total enrollment of USF is 48,373 as of the 2014–2015 academic year which is a huge count compared to any other university in such metropolitan locality.

</string>
    <string name="uni50_2">USF Tampa campus serves more than 41,000 students which consist of 14 colleges and the doctoral granting campus of the USF System. The campus is not attractive nor vast like other heritage university’s campuses, but big enough to teach 41,000 students. There are a few canteens and places to take your stress off within the campus, but everybody prefers to visit bay side of Tampa.

</string>
    <string name="uni50_3">It is said that the administration has a problem with everything that you provide for admissions. There are script rules for admissions at USF, which is the only reason that the data is checked in detail for every student while applying for admission. The professors at the MBA College are considered as one of the best, they seem less like professors and more like your canteen friends. The problem lies is with other degrees where professors tend to be stricter and prefer not to get friendly with any student, which is the reason ego clashes occur between the students and professors. There have been complaints against few professors for not being helpful and university dean also does not pay much attention at such problems because media at Tampa is pretty lame, as the population is quite so nothing happens within Tampa so to get news they’d make news out of such incidents. An abandoned cat on tree can also be news in Tampa.

</string>
    <string name="uni50_4">USF offers public and private financial aid including scholarships, fellowships, grants, work-study programs and loans for which you have to apply while applying for admission. And also there are many other financial helps in which USF Federal Credit Union offers a wide range of banking services, including checking and savings accounts, personal loans, credit cards, mortgages and more to students, faculty and staff. So finance isn’t really a problem if you are applying with legit documents during the admissions. Scholarship can be really helpful as they can pay up to 60% of your whole education expenditure.

</string>
    <string name="uni50_5">USF has good connections within the city and business owners there are always looking for graduates to pass out so that they could offer you their best. There are in-campus placements after every year and semester as well, regarding internships. The average salary for a pass out is 53,000 US$ which is good as compared to other universities in similar locality. Almost half the students are happy with their after-life of USF and most of them have government or white collar jobs. The university also has a great outreach in the fields of sports and has prepared many athletes for a future in sports.

</string>
    <string name="uni50_6">Crowd at USF knows football, eats rugby, talks sports and dreams to be an athlete. You should be a sports person if you are at USF and if you aren’t then you should immediately remove the university’s name from your list. Life without sports at USF is bad; if it’s your birthday and you expect to meet your friends at the canteen but then there is a football match at the university on the same day then you should be prepared to drink your coffee alone. The crowd is chilled out and helpful, most of them are locals who wish to be in university’s football team and rarely will you find a foreigner who would wish to be friends with you.

</string>
    <string name="uni50_7">USF is considered as one of the safest university and students have always rated it as a good university. It is a fact though that the university supports sports to the core of their heart and academics are left out during tournaments. There are high chances that after hearing crowd cheer then you’d close your book and walk towards stadium, sports are pretty influential at USF. The MBA College is considered as one of the best one within the campus of USF and Computer engineering degree is considered as one of the top most one in the state of Florida. The university confirms a job for everyone after the final year, it is a different case if you’d like the job or no, but the university does its best to find a job suitable for you. Apart from the administration security problems there would be few professors you’d have to deal with if you choose other course apart from computer engineering and MBA, else you’d have quite a fun at USF. Do consider the university if you love sports, else you may check other similar universities.

    <string name="uni51_1">Michigan Technological University (MTU) is a public research university founded in the year 1885. The Princeton Review named MTU as “The Best in the Midwest” among all the possible programs. It\'s a very common name on an Indians application list if s/he has an average profile. Moreover, the possibilities of getting an admission here is really high but that should not be taken for granted.

</string>
    <string name="uni51_2">MTU has a picturesque campus with building dedicated to different areas of research which serve as centres of excellence. Dow Environmental Sciences and Engineering Building, The Electrical Energy Resource Center and Advanced Technology Development Complex, which is a start-up discussion hub, are some of the integral parts of the university. The college also has an Industrial Design Centre in collaboration with Ford. Wow!

</string>
    <string name="uni51_3">The course at MTU is well supported by academic advisers to students and the usage of technology in a live lecture. The professors are very knowledgeable and are easily accessible to the students outside lectures for various discussions on their career and research.

</string>
    <string name="uni51_4">For students with decent or even average profiles, getting a fellowship won’t be so difficult at Michgian Technological University. Also, there are a lot of chances that you might get some Fianacial Aid at the time of admission. Students in the past have got anythin from $3,000 to $10,000 fee waiver for the entire course.

</string>
    <string name="uni51_5">To be very honest, the on-campus opportunities won’t be too many here as most major companies prefer students from University of Michigan and Michigan State University during their career fair. However, the state of Michigan itself is extremely industrialised. Possibility of finding jobs in the aerospace, automobile or in the mechanical industry at large is good. So students can be rest assured that there is at least some job scope near and around them.

</string>
    <string name="uni51_6">Again, to tell you the truth the crowd isn’t exactly the most happening place for partying and vibrant people whom you can chill with at MTU. However, if you try hard enough then one can find good set of peers anywhere on the planet. Also, be rational enough to not expect hip-parties and all-night chilling sessions here.
</string>
    <string name="uni51_7">Michigan Technological University is probably a safe choice for even average-to-below average profiles but as we mentioned before, this should not replicate as a \'bad unviersity\'. Low Tuition Fee and Good chances of scholarships are some strong points for MTU. A student with an average profile keen on Mechanical engineering intending to pursue a career in the automotive industry can keep MTU as a last alternative. For the others, well there are more options you could consider.

</string>

    <string name="uni52_1">Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, adorably called as Rutgers or Rutgers University, is a public research university located in the small city of Newark in New Jersey. Founded in 1766, Rutgers is one of the high ranking universities in the States which mean you need a mind blowing profile to get in. Earlier know as the Newark School of Engineering, the institution is very famous for its Electrical and Computer Engineering program especially Wireless. It’s a dream college for an above average profile and generally students having achievements through their undergraduate course make it to this college.

</string>
    <string name="uni52_2">The campus at Rutgers is spread over a massive 2,700 acres and you really wonder what they’ve in this huge size? Apart from the hundreds of buildings, some of which need to go under construction while some are way to modern, there are more than 10 main libraries encompassing around millions of volumes of various courses. Multiple student study centre, many recreational centers, followed by cafeterias, completes the infrastructure of Rutgers.

</string>
    <string name="uni52_3">As Rutgers is associated with the Association of American Universities, the professors here are just class apart. Almost all of them are busy with their own research and enjoy it to the core. From Phds\' to Nobel laureates and some other crazy degrees, the lecturers at Rutgers are something to look for. They’re friendly, helpful (obviously, if you approach them) and amicable, though opinions will differ on this statement as barely few of them are arrogant and stubborn.

</string>
    <string name="uni52_4">C’mon! We’re talking about one of the top 10 universities in America. It’s the most ambitious public university in the States; hence you need a breath taking profile to get some F-aid. Research and Teaching Assistantships are easy to get provided you’ve all your academics, project work submitted time to time.

</string>
    <string name="uni52_5">The strategic location and the class of students that come to this university, has put the college in an excellent league even from the placements point of view. Accenture, IBM, Deutsche Bank, Merrill Lynch, Deloitte and several other big names and MNC’s come to this university for recruitment. Yes, you are paid handsomely by these companies starting from anything around $50,000 going up to hundred thousand dollars.

</string>
    <string name="uni52_6">Rutgers has one of the most diverse crowds in comparison to all the American Universities. Starting from whites to blacks, Asians (yeah, Indians majorly) to Africans; California to New York and all parts of the world, the university has students from all the possible combinations in the world. While the ratio of boys and girls are the same, looks and appearance wise, there are definitely more chicks and studs. Boys, thank god!
</string>
    <string name="uni52_7">If you’re told to summarize the Rutgers in a word, don’t forget to call it IDEAL. Excellent location, state funded university, big companies popping during placements, less fees and the kind of students that are admitted to this university gives it a double THUMBS UP! One of the ambitious colleges on a way above average profile.

</string>

    <string name="uni53_1">University of Utah (U of U) is a public flagship university founded in the year 1850. This university is known for its computer art, computer animation and allied fields which has led to a number of applications for the course on Games Development. U of U is also very active in the athletics scene in the US and has consistently done well in all sports.

</string>
    <string name="uni53_2">U of U has a picturesque campus spread over 1500 acres. There are two major libraries namely the J. Willard Marriott and S. J. Quinney library. There is a Presidents circle with a number of buildings named after previous college presidents. The primary student activity centre is the A. Ray Olpin University Union, and campus fitness centres include the Health, Physical Education, and Recreation Complex (HPER) and the Nielsen Fieldhouse.

</string>
    <string name="uni53_3">Another big plus point here at University of Utah is the faculty. Students across all disciplines have great things to say about their professors. All of them believe that the professors are well-read, deeply into research and easily approachable outside class to discuss various relevant issues like research and projects. Similarly positive reviews on the course curriculum and program flexibility have been obtained from students.

</string>
    <string name="uni53_4">University of Utah being a public research university, there is every chance that a student with a decent above average profile can get some scholarship or assistantship.

</string>
    <string name="uni53_5">Salt Lake City, the location of the university is an industrial city with a number of Fortune ranked organizations like Huntsmann Corporation, Sinclair Oil Corporation and organizations like eBay and Adobe having offices near and around. Keeping all these in mind and the fact that there are a number of career fairs in Utah, you shouldn’t be worrying too much about the placements.

</string>
    <string name="uni53_6">Food wise there’s a lot of variety, you could choose on the basis of the size of your wallet or the demand of your taste buds. Nightlife isn’t really the best here; there are certain restrictions although smaller house parties and a few fraternity gatherings here-and-there are common. The alcohol people need not fear since the options are many and also pretty cheap.

</string>
    <string name="uni53_7">University of Utah is definitely NOT in the top bracket as yet. However, there isn’t anything blatantly flawed in any aspect that we can see. The Games Development course deserves a special mention again, else keeping it as a safe option (for an above average profile) for any branch is our opinion.

</string>

   //staff <string name="uni54_1">Founded in 1861, University of Washington is one of the oldest universities on the North West Coast of the United States of America. UW, commonly referred, is a public research university in the city of Seattle and is also labelled as a part of the Public Ivies (comparable to Ivy League institues).

    <string name="uni57_1">Although it’ll no doubt be fascinating and highly inspiring to read about MIT, it could also give you a serious inferiority complex. Because Massachusetts Institute of Technology is perhaps the best overall college in the world, and it makes sure its students are no less. To get into MIT, you need to be excellent in everything, and even that probably won’t be enough.
</string>
    <string name="uni57_2">MIT is a pretty self-sufficient student town, so to speak. The sheer magnificence of everything at MIT would certainly dazzle any common man. It’s spread over 168 acres and has everything a student could possibly ask for. There are close to 20 research centers on campus, which explore topics as varied as cancer research, ocean engineering, and soldier nanotechnologies. The infrastructure here is excellent, with top-of-the-line facilities for over 30 sports and other recreational facilities. The round-the-clock libraries are certainly among the best in the world, with over 3 million volumes covering a range of topics.

</string>
    <string name="uni57_3">Isn’t it obvious, really?
MIT is known to have The Best faculty in the world. A number of faculty members are Nobel Laureates and even the others are highly renowned in academic circles. </string>
    <string name="uni57_4">Well even if scholarships were available, it’s highly unlikely that you’ll be getting them unless you’ve done something absolutely extraordinary, like leading your country to a gold medal in some sport, or discovering a new element or two. Or maybe if you’re the next Albert Einstein.

</string>
    <string name="uni57_5">There are a number of on-campus part-time jobs that you can do. Assisting professors, helping out in the library, teaching juniors – all of these are common things students do to ‘get by’. Devoting a few hours a week isn’t too difficult, and part-time jobs really don’t stress you out much either. It’s all very doable.

</string>
    <string name="uni57_6">Although you might expect MIT to be overpopulated with absolute nerds, this is far from the truth. The simple reason for this is that outscoring the rest of the world academically just isn’t enough to get into MIT. You need to be exceptionally good at EVERYTHING. Any normal human would be quite overwhelmed if he sees the quality of students at the institute.
</string>
    <string name="uni57_7">Come on. It’s MIT. MIT! Do you really need us to say something?

    <string name="uni58_1">Northwestern University is a private research university founded in 1851. While the campus is somewhat divided into two halves (the Evanston campus and the Chicago campus), we’re only going to talk about the one at Evanston, since that’s where all engineering students are going to end up. Now while Northwestern is known for the very excellent Kellogg School of Management, it’s important to know that just about every other area of study at the university is quite a handful as well.

</string>
    <string name="uni58_2">If you could say one thing for certain about Northwestern, it would definitely be that it’s immensely pleasing to the eye. The campus looks excellent from a distance, and turns out even more fabulous once you actually set foot in it. The buildings are designed in a number of different architectural styles, and although that doesn’t sound entirely great, it appears just that once you look at it. The library system has over 5 million volumes covering subjects from Anything-You-May-Need to Everything-You-May-Need. They have some fantastic recreation centers, athletic centers, and a very beautiful aquatics center.

</string>
    <string name="uni58_3">Although the engineering programs aren’t half as reputed as some other programs (read Management, Theatre), they’re pretty darn good anyway. Thanks to its rather excellent location, NU is able to attract some of the top professors of their respective fields, and the professors in turn teach with a passion and dedication unparalleled in most parts of the world. Of course, at the end of the day, academics are what you make of them, but you can rest assured about one thing – if you want to learn, the professors are always there to make sure you do.

</string>
    <string name="uni58_4">Oh well, it’s a private university, which means you come to it if you can afford it. That said, they naturally aren’t too generous, but if you have the acads to back your demand, scholarships aren’t impossible.

</string>
    <string name="uni58_5">Chicago is a city that’s just begging you to get out and take advantage of the millions of opportunities in it. You can be assured of a good job if you pass out of NU, but make sure that this knowledge doesn’t let your levels of competition slip.

</string>
    <string name="uni58_6">Even if the crowd was bad, it wouldn’t have been a problem, really. It’s Chicago - you can find just about everything you want to do, and a million people to do it with you. Of course, that’s something you’d have to worry about if the people at NU were bad. As luck would have it, you’ll find a nice multicultural mix, and the general consensus is that there are people of all shapes and sizes (both physically and otherwise), and that it’s not at all a task to find agreeable company. And once you’re out of the confines of the campus, Chicago has a plethora of bars, restaurants, parties, you name it. It’s a brilliant city, and it takes care of you. Really.

</string>
    <string name="uni58_7">While the engineering school (McCormick) at Northwestern may not live up to the name of its management brother Kellogg, it’s an excellent school anyway. Armed with the undeniable lure of Chicago, it’s definitely one of the better schools abroad.

    <string name="uni59_1">The Santa Clara University was established in the year 1851 and has a highly illustrious history of education and social service. The motto of this Jesuit University reads ‘For the greater glory of God’ (translated from English) and true to this inspiring line, this University in California has always strived towards brightening the lives of the many generations that have passed out over the last 164 years of its glorious existence.

</string>
    <string name="uni59_2">The Santa Clara University is located in Santa Clara, California, United States. The city of San Jose lies just next to Santa Clara County where this University is housed.

</string>
    <string name="uni59_3">The Santa Clara University has a treasure-house of the most experienced and reputed faculty in California. The University is home to around 522 full-time faculty. The knowledge imparted by each of the professors at the SCU is combined with the latest pedagogy which gives students an opportunity to adapt to real-world situations without any effort. There are many world-renowned faculty in the University as well and their expertise in their own field bestows them with a vast expanse of knowledge that is very helpful to the students here!

</string>
    <string name="uni59_4">Student loans are available at the Santa Clara University for students who wish to apply. There are plenty of scholarships, departmental grants and federal loans as well for deserving students at the University.

</string>
    <string name="uni59_5">The placements of the Santa Clara University are always conducted towards the end of the educational year. Most of its students get placed in leading companies and organisations. Many of its alumni have gone on to open up successful firms of their own!

</string>
    <string name="uni59_6">The Santa Clara University offers a wide range of recreational activities for its students on campus. The overall environment of the University is lively and full of vibrant and multi-cultural students. There are many centres of extra-curricular activities that students can pursue during their leisure time. Some of these include music, dance, athletics and even spirituality. There is a campus ministry that offers free spiritual services to those of the Jesuit order. There are plenty of activities to keep its students occupied and attached with the whole community at large.
</string>
    <string name="uni59_7">The Santa Clara University leaves a lasting impact on its students, both in terms of educational as well as cultural values. The varied curriculum and amazing faculty make for the perfect combination for a successful career in whichever field you wish to pursue.

    <string name="uni60_1">Boston University (BU) is a private research university which got its name in 1869. In the city of Boston, which is famous for being a college city bustling with student life, BU is one of the more recognized universities. It is a students’ favourite, because of several factors – the quality of education, the quality of life, and the quality of women. All this combined with the fact that it isn’t exactly impossible to get in.

</string>
    <string name="uni60_2">As the name quite clearly suggests, the institute is located at Boston, Massachusetts. Boston is one of the busiest cities in the world, but that doesn’t mean that people are working round the clock. It’s one of those cities where, if you’ll forgive the use of the cliché, people ‘work hard and party harder’.

</string>
    <string name="uni60_3">As is the case in many excellent institutes, Boston University has some professors who can directly alter the course of your life. In a good way, of course. While most of the professors can comfortably be categorized as ‘well above average’, there are some who just fall under the ‘mind blowing’ category. Often you may find yourself wanting to take up a particular course/subject purely and solely because a particular professor would be tutoring you. Hopefully that’ll be for academic and not aesthetic reasons.

</string>
    <string name="uni60_4">Since BU is a private university, it’s not terribly easy to get any ‘freeships’ as such, but of course you can get Teaching Assistantships and Research Assistantships.

</string>
    <string name="uni60_5">Since BU is one of the better colleges around, it certainly shouldn’t be a problem getting a pretty-high-paying job once you’re here. Where you get placed naturally depends on the course you’re doing, but more often than not, you can expect to get picked up by one of the top players in whatever field you’re specializing in.

</string>
    <string name="uni60_6">When you’re in the middle of a huge city like Boston, the crowd and life within your college somewhat ceases to matter, since you have so much to do outside of the campus. Having said that, the crowd at Boston University is pretty good anyway. It’s a nice mix of the very-academically-inclined and not-so-academically-inclined. And there are some cute women around, too.
</string>
    <string name="uni60_7">Good college, great city. You’ll never regret it.

</string>

    <string name="uni61_1">The very famous Stanford University is a private research university located near Palo Alto in California. There is not much that can be said about Stanford which is not been said before. Simply, if anyone gets into Stanford, he takes it blindly. Of course, before reading further, you ought to know that it’s nearly impossible to get an admit here. To get an idea of exactly how competitive Stanford is, you don’t have to look further than the long list of prominent companies founded by Stanford alumni- Google, Hewlett-Packard, LinkedIn, Yahoo, Sun Microsystems. And that’s not even one tenth of the list.

</string>
    <string name="uni61_2">Stanford University is built on a whopping 8180 acre campus. Although some parts aren’t exactly developed, the infrastructure in the developed region is an absolute treat to the eyes. The huge campus is home to over 25,000 trees, a beautiful lake, more than 700 buildings and its very own power plant. Stanford even has a 2 mile linear accelerator abbreviated as ‘SLAC’.
</string>
    <string name="uni61_3">When you’re at Stanford, you can expect first rate education, and faculty to match. The professors are highly reputed pioneers in their own field, which is why Stanford can boast of over 50 noble laureates. In spite of their achievements, professors are extremely approachable and very understanding. All in all, the learning process at Stanford is fantastic.

</string>
    <string name="uni61_4">Since Stanford is a private university, scholarships are few and far difficult to get and even if you’ve to be one of those, your profile should be more than breathtakingly good.

</string>
    <string name="uni61_5">Stanford students usually are seen working for Bain, Microsoft, Google, Oracle and Goldman Sachs, to name a few. Oh and they earn rather a lot.

</string>
    <string name="uni61_6">Since most of the students have probably been nerds throughout their life, don’t expect to meet a tremendously hep crowd. Having said that, the crowd still certainly ain’t that bad. There are a number of academic over achievers, who probably have some sporting achievements to brag about as well. Infact, in the 2008 Olympics, Stanford amassed a breath taking 25 medals for the US of A.
</string>
    <string name="uni61_7">
Oh come on!</string>

    <string name="uni62_1">The Polytechnic Institute of New York University (also known as New York University School of Engineering and Technology) is a part of, as the name suggests, NYU, which is a private research university. Started in 1854 in Brooklyn, which is now part of New York City, NYU Poly is one of the oldest technical institutes in the country, and arguably one of the best. The twin strengths of an excellent reputation and an even better location ensure that it gets a massive number of applications from all over the world, including India, of course.

</string>
    <string name="uni62_2">Now, since the institute is located in the middle of NYC, you really can’t expect a massive, sprawling campus. Yet, NYU Poly manages to stretch across about 20 acres, which isn’t too bad, really. It also has all sorts of ultramodern facilities, and a brand new library which has over a million volumes of just about anything you may need. There aren’t really bars and pubs on campus, but that shouldn’t really be an issue, considering you have the whole of NYC right outside waiting for you to come and spoil yourself.

</string>
    <string name="uni62_3">Either the faculty really is fantastic, or students have been hypnotized into thinking so. Of course, no one can argue with the fact that the professors are highly qualified and knowledgeable – some are Nobel laureates, for crying out loud – but very often excellent professors come with equally excellent egos. However, everyone is somehow full of praise for the professors, with not a single complaint escaping their lips. From what we gather – and we think it’s probably true – professors are very friendly and are willing to go out of their way to guide students, provided some initiative comes from the right end, of course.

</string>
    <string name="uni62_4">Being a private university, NYU Poly tends to be slightly thrifty when it comes to doling out scholarships, so the chance that you’ll end up with one isn’t terribly high. Fortunately, though, you could always get yourself some Research or Teaching Assistantships which should keep your head above the water. Just.

</string>
    <string name="uni62_5">In a nutshell, all the effort and hard work involved in first getting into, and then getting through two ‘grueling’ years at NYU Poly, seems completely worthwhile once you land yourself a job. The options are fantastic and the packages you get are pretty hair-raising too. Recruiters like Microsoft, IBM, Google are regulars at NYU Poly, and the salaries they offer more than do justice to your job.

</string>
    <string name="uni62_6">NYU Poly has a brilliantly multicultural environment, and having said that, it’s healthy rather than racist. Which is a good thing, by the way. But that’s all we’re going to say, because, frankly, you’re wasting your life if you come to New York City and limit yourself to a college, a university or even an area. NYC has a plethora of options for anyone and everyone, and it’ll be plain daft to sit in college waiting for something to happen, when you have a whole world of opportunities to explore outside. Yes, the crowd at NYU Poly is pretty good by itself too, but why settle for Okay when you can have Great, or even Out-Of-The-World?
</string>
    <string name="uni62_7">Your author would probably have gone without second thought, but that’s because he loves NYC, and the women there, way too much. But an unbiased word of advice – if you get into universities comparable to NYU Poly, you can do far worse than choosing it over any other; big cities really make a huge difference, to your education, your job prospects, and most importantly, your personality.

    //facul job <string name="uni63_1">Auburn University is a public research university located in Auburn, Alabama. Founded in 1856, it is one of the most popular university in Alabama, but not exactly that renowned all over. Anyhow, you often find a number of Indians applying to it, mostly as a ‘safe’ option if they have an average profile.

</string>
    <string name="uni63_2">The modish campus, built over 341 acres, is arranged in a grid like fashion with distinct building groups. The engineering buildings have the business school for company in the northern sector of the central campus. The whole university looks really beautiful, with a lovely blend of some traditional-looking and some modernistic buildings. Many of the research centres are brand new, so you can be forgiven for missing a couple of heartbeats the first time you set foot in them.

</string>
    <string name="uni63_3">While it’s not too difficult to get some kind of scholarship, it’s unfair to expect a bomb unless you have a profile that deserves it. Which, of course, begs the question – if you have an excellent profile, why come here?

</string>
    <string name="uni63_4">It’s not terribly easy to settle at Auburn if you’re used to the hustle and bustle of a big city. Yes, it does get boring at times, but on the bright side, they’re a million things to do which you probably wouldn’t have the chance, time, or inclination to do were you in, say, NYC. Students often go out hiking, and can be found swimming in the fantastic pool through spring, summer and fall.
</string>
    <string name="uni63_5">The jury is still out on Auburn. While students are full of praise for it, the rankings and the general reputation somewhat tend to disagree.

</string>


    <string name="uni64_1">University of California – Santa Barbara is a public research university founded in 1905. Any student with an inherent desire to ‘chill’ should definitely put UCSB at the top of his wish-list. A perfect combination of location, climate, teaching, crowd and nightlife ensures that no one would ever regret going to Santa Barbara.

</string>
    <string name="uni64_2">UCSB is spread over a sprawling 1000 acre campus, with a host of facilities for anything and everything you can think of. The library may look like it comes from another era, but it is brilliantly stocked with over a few million volumes. There are state-of-the-art recreation centers in the campus, and excellent infrastructure for sports. There are four (yes, four!) basketball courts, racquetball courts, Jacuzzis, and a number of grounds for other sports.

</string>
    <string name="uni64_3">UCSB does not have a huge number of graduate students, which explains why there are a fewer number of dedicated professors for graduate courses than undergraduate courses. The faculty is pretty approachable, though, and professors are highly qualified in their own fields.
</string>
    <string name="uni64_4">Getting direct financial aid (or freeship) isn’t straightforward at UCSB, but other university grants such as Research Assistantship are easier to come by.

</string>
    <string name="uni64_5">Since UCSB is one of the better colleges around, it certainly shouldn’t be a problem getting a pretty-high-paying job once you’re here. Where you get placed naturally depends on the course you’re doing, but more often than not, you can expect to get picked up by one of the top players in whatever field you’re specializing in.

</string>
    <string name="uni64_6">Most of the UCSB students live at Isla Vista. One reason for this may be the fantastic beaches, Devurex and Sands, nearby, which are bustling with students at almost any time of the day. The ‘party street’, Del Playa Drive, is on a cliff overlooking the ocean, and is quite a sight really. There are at least 20 parties happening here every weekend, and it’ll be silly for students to chill anywhere else. The parties are out of the world, obviously. No wonder students don’t want to leave UCSB.
</string>
    <string name="uni64_7">It’s difficult to get in, and there’s obviously a very good reason for this. With two years of quality education, you’re also guaranteed two years of mad fun.

</string>

    <string name="uni65_1">Founded in 1949, California State University, Long Beach, popularly known as CSULB, is a large, 4-year public university. Long Beach is a large city and provides a suburban setting, offering bachelors, masters and doctoral degrees. For graduate students, CSULB offers programs at the College of Business Administration, College of Engineering, College of Health and Human Services, among other schools.

</string>
    <string name="uni65_2">CSU LB is a sprawling 322-acre campus abd has the third largest campus in the CSU system. The unique aspect of the campus is the large grass fields (unless droughts) with dashing Helen Borcher flowering 3000 peach trees donated by the locals. It has a huge outdoor gallery with statues and monuments. The school is completely wheelchair accessible, which is a commendable thing. (The Disabled Students Union is very good too.)
</string>
    <string name="uni65_3">The study schedule can be quite rigorous especially if you have multiple, inter-clashing majors. However, it is said that 1/4th of the classes happen in the evening. Students find the evening classes to be less rigorous than the day classes, primarily because the professors are a little fatigued (for obvious reasons). So for the students who wish to do slightly less work to earn their grade, can opt for night classes.

</string>
    <string name="uni65_4">The administration at CSULB recommend that one should apply for a scholarship. Every year about 8 million dollars worth scholarships go unused because students don\'t apply. The career centre is helpful if you are looking for a job. On-campus tuition for out-state students may cost approximately $17000 and room and boarding are another $12000. For in-state, it is around $6000. There are miscellaneous course fees if you are an out-state graduate student, depending on the number of credits you take. One must look into that.

</string>
    <string name="uni65_5">Placements may not be the best despite the career centre being very helpful. It is an average public institution in this aspect. But again, students say that the employers in California may have a good respect for this school when one goes for the interviews. It holds a good repute.

</string>
    <string name="uni65_6">CSULB is a co-ed college which has above 37,000 students on campus. CSULB is known for its kinesiology and athletic training programs. CSULB athletes participate in NCAA Division 1 sports like baseball, women\'s tennis, and women\'s soccer, as well as both men\'s and women\'s basketball, and golf teams.
</string>
    <string name="uni65_7">A little biased towards locals and Hispanics, it may not be the most preferred place for out-state or international students. Parking is a little difficult. Previously a lot of famous people like Steven Spielberg studied there, which sure makes it fascinating. Political setting is leaning towards liberals and the Republicans/conservatives could have a hard time. Sports and clubs are promoted. The infrastructure has its charm. The weather is in your favour. Cal state universities are known for their practical approach. Overall, good opportunities are many and it is a better-than-average public institution.

</string>

    <string name="uni66_1">Founded in 1870 and established as a land-grant institution, Colorado State is a fully accredited public university. Colorado State offers more than 190 programs of study within eight colleges. Colorado State is the "University of Choice" for Colorado residents; 30% of all of Colorado\'s science, math, and engineering and technology majors pursue degrees at CSU.

</string>
    <string name="uni66_2">The weather is the biggest negative about this place. This is not the place to be if you like year-long warmth. People who have moved to Fort Collins complain that the weather here is harsh and controls your activities. You do not just go out and do things - you\'ve got to plan ahead whether it\'s summer of winter. Winters are long and cold and summers are only for a month and a half. Dry air and winds are a nuisance.

</string>
    <string name="uni66_3">Having 1540 faculty members, with the faculty to student ratio being 1:18, there is a little disappointment of huge class sizes at CSU. The university provides 72 majors, over 125 concentrations and over 80 minors. The pedagogy includes extremely qualified professors and most students seem to be happy with the faculty. There is a range of professors you\'ll find: old and strict vs young and flexible. Courses for which CSU is ranked high are Civil Engineering, Occupational Therapy, Environmental Engineering, Chemistry, Business, etc.
</string>
    <string name="uni66_4">Average tuition for non-residents at Colorado State University is $26000 for graduate and $29000 for undergraduate and the total expenditure remains under $45000 per year. They provide assistantships, scholarships, grants and fellowships that one can apply to. There are specific scholarships for international students such as AIFS Study Abroad Scholarships, NAFSA: Financial Aid for Undergraduate International Students and President’s Scholarship. Most scholarships are merit-based. There are various study abroad loans and campus jobs available for students. However, the students feel it would be great to get a greater access to financial aid.

</string>
    <string name="uni66_5">Average earning of a CSU alumni six years after graduation is $44,000. There are frequent campus fairs, networking sessions, career tools for students to constantly try their abilities. ‘Handshake\' is their online portal which connects students and alumni with employers through online job postings. Notable companies recruiting from the CSU campus are HP, Kaiser, Soft Nice Inc, Antea Group USA, Morgan Stanley, Utah Transit Authority, CSG International, Omni Hotels, etc.

</string>
    <string name="uni66_6">Colorado state has over 30,000 students on campus (about 7000 graduates) out of which international students are about 1300 from 85 countries. There is a student-run radio station, television station and a daily newspaper. The Ramskeller Pub is well known among students to grab a bite, drink a local New Belgium brew, play pool and listen to music.
</string>
    <string name="uni66_7">Colorado State University with a sprawling campus and state-of-the-art facilities is a good bet if you have your financial aid sorted. You must be careful in choosing your classes and advisors. Overall, it falls into the category of the top schools in the western part of the US.

</string>

    <string name="uni67_1">Beginning its journey as the Triple Cities College in 1946, the growth of State University of New York (SUNY) has been quick and prolific. Started as a fledgling college and a part of the Syracuse University, SUNY quickly became one of the top colleges in recent times.
</string>
    <string name="uni67_2">The infrastructure and place of SUNY is something that is wonderful to behold. Spread across 930 acres, the campus has housing for the undergraduate students which is mandatory. With 190 acres of preserved forests, woods, wetlands, lakes and more, you have the opportunity to truly connect with nature without losing touch of the modern world as well.
</string>
    <string name="uni67_3">With established authors such as david Sloan Wilson (Evolution for Everyone), Guggenheim fellow Isodore Okpewho, distinguished professor of Africana Studies, nationally recognised professors such as Jessica Fridrich (electrical engineering) and Francis J.Yammarino (Director, Center of Leadership Studies), you can be sure that you are getting top-notch education.

</string>
    <string name="uni67_4">With almost 49% percent of the student body getting some form of financial aid or the other, it is not hard to get the kind of aid you need here. The average amount that you can get as financial aid is around $8,065.
</string>
    <string name="uni67_5">With the Fleishman Centre for Career and Professional Development, you get the know-how of applying for internships and jobs from the get go. The average salary for a bachelors degree is around $47,000 and can go up to $90,000. More than half of the graudating students have high paying jobs.

</string>
    <string name="uni67_6">Living in SUNY is great as it will give you freedom and independence, especially if you have moved to another country altogether. With a huge scope for outdoor activities, you can explore nature with hikes, treks and campouts on a regular basis. Alcohol is permitted in the campus for those of legal age so you can expect quite a bit of partying to go on as well. There are a lot of college events and charity fundraisers that you can take part in, if you are interested and can also apply for internships and jobs within the campus.
</string>
    <string name="uni67_7">SUNY has a lot of advantages under its kitty. With a huge campus, dedicated forests and reserves, studying amongst nature is a huge plus on its own. It has a wide scope and the turnout is known for its pros rather than the cons. So, if you are looking at SUNY Binghamton, the choice is a no-brainer.

    <string name="uni69_1">The highly renowned California Institute of Technology is a private research university started in the year 1891. Located in Pasadena, Caltech has gained a reputation as one of the best technological institutes in the world. Understandably, it receives a massive number of applications from all over the world, including thousands from India. However, it isn’t easy to get in. In fact, Caltech is arguably one of the toughest universities to get into; call it bias, prejudice, or racism, Caltech just doesn’t seem to admit enough Indians. Though we think this perhaps has something to do with the extremely high levels of expectation here, and not much else.

</string>
    <string name="uni69_2">Built on a fantastic 124 acre campus, Caltech really is an architectural marvel. All the buildings that may have weathered over the years have been demolished and reconstructed to perfection. Everything at the California Institute of Technology is state of the art – the research centers, the labs, the libraries, lecture halls, even the bathrooms. There are a couple of cafes on campus itself, and you often find students hanging out there itself.

</string>
    <string name="uni69_3">The learning experience at Caltech is almost unparalleled. Although students find the academic program, well, rigorous to say the least, they end up enjoying it too. Studying under some of the most knowledgeable and renowned professors in the world is certainly a pleasure, although students sometimes complain of them being a bit too involved in their ‘top secret’ research activities. That being said, many professors are more than willing to go out of their way if students show interest; in fact, many professors are immensely keen on teaching, so as to impart their tremendously vast wisdom to the next generation.

</string>
    <string name="uni69_4">Since it’s a private university, it’s not really easy getting scholarships at Caltech. Add to that the fact that you’ll be competing with some of the brightest minds in the world, and well, we really doubt it’s happening.

</string>
    <string name="uni69_5">This, though, we’re sure would be absolutely out of the world. If the history of the institute didn’t already give it enough of an upper hand, its location adds to the advantage. Some of the best companies in the world from various fields visit Caltech and pick up its students, with the hope that they’ll one day lead the pack wherever they are.

</string>
    <string name="uni69_6">While there are constant complaints about the gender disparity (men outnumber women about three or more times) and the lack of well-dressed women, it’s not impossible to find agreeable people of either gender. Of course, very often you have to ‘make do’ with frustratingly geeky guys and girls, but Caltech students eventually start finding geekery mildly attractive. Yes we know, it may sound rather gay, but well that’s how it is.
</string>

    <string name="uni73_1">From being a teacher college, the movement of Texas A&amp;amp;amp;M University-Kingsville was swift but measured. Having been chartered in 1917 and opened in 1925, the college quickly grew to take on more courses and handing out more degrees that any other colleges in the region. This holds true even today as it offers the most scholarships and courses in the Southern Texas region. Incorporated into the Texas A&amp;amp;amp;m system in 1989, the name of the university also changed to reflect this. With diverse course options for both the undergraduate and the graduate level, the standard of education is very high.

</string>
    <string name="uni73_2">Since the majority of the student body is Hispanic, the architecture of the University also resounds this heritage. With red-tiled roofs, curving turrets and more, the college infrastructure as well exudes diversity. With 1061 acres of land, the main bulk of the buildings can still be found in just 250 acres which consists of 85 buildings.
</string>
    <string name="uni73_3">With almost 75% of the faculty having a Ph.D, there is an assurance of getting top-of-the-line education. Not only if there a ratio of 21:1, you can be sure that the teachers will guide you and help out in the tutoring centres as well. Thanks to the faculty, the highest number of graduates and scholarships awarded are from this University.

</string>
    <string name="uni73_4">Although the acceptance rate is quite high at 83%, the financial aid you will receive is mostly in the form of scholarships, grants (for research students) and the option of Work-study. This means that they will employ you in the campus and waive the fees that still needs to be paid from it. This can be done as teachers assistants and research assistants. You will get to learn more and work a particular amount of hours in exchange for your tuition getting rebated.

</string>
    <string name="uni73_5">With engineering subjects being one of the top picked subjects in the university, the number of job offers that come in are more in their favour. With a decent salary, the students are either not too satisfied or quit soon enough to study more.

</string>
    <string name="uni73_6">There are a number of things to do in and around the campus. Along with a major sports vibe that runs throughout the university, you get to join any club that you are interested in ranging from the Agriculture club to the arts club, robotics club and much more.
</string>
    <string name="uni73_7">While the university is still small, you get the opportunity to learn a lot by living with a multitude of races and people from across the country. As an international student, you get the opportunity to live and study independently.

    <string name="uni74_1">Oklahoma State University is a public research university founded in the year 1890. It was originally known as Oklahoma Agricultural &amp;amp;amp; Mechanical College (similar to everyone’s favourite TAMU). Sometimes referred as OKState, is at best a mid-level tier-2 university. The Princeton Review rated it among the top 50 “Best Value Colleges-Public” for the year 2010. Over the last 3 years, it has become one of the most preferred universities for Management Information Systems (MIS) for an average profile under his/her \'safe\' bet.

</string>
    <string name="uni74_2">Established in the year 1890, the OSUtoday, stands on an impressive area of more than 1450 acres of land which is equipped for carrying out all types of advanced scientific research. The university has an Advanced Technology Research Center where all the engineering related research is carried out. Besides this, the campus also boasts of a library which is known as Edmon Low library. This library is located on the main campus of the university and houses over 3 million books along with the subscription to all the online databases. For students pursuing courses in different forms of performing arts, the university has set up the Seretean Centre for the Performing Arts.

</string>
    <string name="uni74_3">The faculty here does have an interest in teaching and imparting knowledge to others. The number of teaching assistants and their constant guidance in the course is especially mentioned here by the students. However, on the down-side some professors are not very approachable and not helpful and they “couldn’t care less” if you existed or no but if you do show them some interest and respect there is a high chance you may be rewarded with some research work or project.

</string>
    <string name="uni74_4">Good profiles will definitely be rewarded with financial aid at the time of taking admission. Since it\'s a mid-tier university and has a public status, the chances to get a Financial aid is really high. Internship scenario is decent after one year completion of Masters.

</string>
    <string name="uni74_5">The location leads to the placements taking a hit. Good students should push for placements off-campus by visiting career and job fairs outside. Nevertheless, there is still some campus placement where the average placement package was about $50,000-$60,000.

</string>
    <string name="uni74_6">There is a strong culture for athletics in the college which people love to indulge in and cheer for their home team. Also, on the bright side is the fact that the nightlife and partying scene is pretty good compared to most other colleges across USA. So, those keen on having a good time can surely put their doubts to rest. For those with tricky taste buds, the off-campus dining options are highly varied and one won’t have to keep returning to the same place again-and-again. Jack in the Box and House of Greek are some of the more popular restaurants.

</string>
    <string name="uni74_7">For an average student Oklahoma State University can be considered as a safe admit. The low fee and plausible chances of ascholarship can be a plus for you but keep in mind the location and the tough placement situation and the extra effort you may have to put in for the same when you take your final decision.

    <string name="uni75_1">University of Pittsburgh is a public research university founded in 1787. As the name suggests, the institution is located in the large city of Pittsburgh and state Pennsylvania. UPitt has been in the top cluster of seven leading public universities and is ranked in the top 30 of the States. Even though there are the likes of CMU and UPenn in the same state, UPitt is also one of the hot favourites of an average Indian student profile considering that it’s a public university.

</string>
    <string name="uni75_2">The UPitt campus is spread over 132 acres which is quite less as compared to the hundreds of universities in the US of A. One of the vast libraries in the USA, UPitt has more than 15 main libraries covering millions of volumes of all the possible courses. There are various recreational centers within the campus starting from basketball court to the gymnasium followed with multiple cafeterias and bars.

</string>
    <string name="uni75_3">Faculty at UPitt is known for its level of cooperativeness provided you approach them with your doubts. Most of the professors have some crazy-sounding degrees and PhDs, and some are Nobel laureates as well. Students are pretty satisfied with their teachers though some complain about the accent of foreign professors.

</string>
    <string name="uni75_4">Though UPitt is a definitely a notch below its brothers CMU and UPenn, it surely isn’t that simple to get in for a just about average profile. As the university is funded by the state of Pennsylvania, students do get a Financial aid/scholarship depending upon the level of the profile. Yes, Research and Teaching Assistantship are gettable if you maintain your academics well above the average mark.

</string>
    <string name="uni75_5">Now, getting a job isn’t something you should worry about at UPitt. But getting the job you’ve always dreamt of isn’t going to be terribly easy. It’s a good idea to get in touch with the Career Center well in advance, while also making sure that your acads are up to the mark throughout college. Get that done, and you should be fine. Delollite Consulting, PWC, US Airways, US Navy, American Eagle, Ford Motor Company, and Walt Disney World are the standard MNC’s that hire graduate students from the University of Pittsburgh.

</string>
    <string name="uni75_6">Well, most of the students in UPitt are from the nearby cities and states of USA followed by a few Asians (Indians majorly). There is an equal ratio of boys and girls within the university but girls outdo boys in terms of appearance and looks. Many student communities and festivals run round the year with sports like ball game, football and baseball being the favourites of this university.
</string>
    <string name="uni75_7">The strategic location of the city, the variation in weather and elder brothers like CMU and UPenn, raises the bar of University of Pittsburgh. Though most of the students dream to get into the other two, it’s a good bet for an average profile to join Upitt.

</string>
    <string name="uni76_4">Georgia State University views its financial aid program as an investment in students and their futures.

    <string name="uni77_1">Texas Tech University is a public research institution in the college town of Lubbock that was founded in 1923. Its setting is urban, and it offers a wide variety of graduate programs, including degrees through the Jerry S. Rawls College of Business Administration, the Edward E. Whitacre Jr. College of Engineering and the School of Law.

</string>
    <string name="uni77_2">With a sprawling 1893-acre main campus in Lubbock, Texas houses the main academic university, law school, and medical school. The campus boasts of Spanish architecture with a large section of the campus listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Museum of Texas University is home to three million objects and specimens with a planetarium and research laboratory. The Northern side of the campus has a museum called National Ranching Heritage Center which is home to many historic things such as windmills, chuck-wagons, and a coal-burning locomotive.
</string>
    <string name="uni77_3">With 1546 full-time faculty and 194 part-time, the faculty to student ratio is 22:1. One disadvantage definitely is that there is less one on one teaching with more auditorium style classes. Some of the classes may even have 100 students but that could be the price of being at a big school. You may require a prior appointment to meet with your academic advisor. At Texas Tech, the STEM courses have a lavish reign. Kinesiology and Mechanical engineering programs are the most popular. The school has also sent a dozen astronauts to NASA. Marketing is one of the most popular courses in its Business School program.

</string>
    <string name="uni77_4">Students find the study here economical because of the varied scholarship opportunities available. They have a big hospitality department and diversified course works which increases the opportunities for part-time jobs. An average of 45% of students get one or other kind of scholarship and the average amount is of $4500.

</string>
    <string name="uni77_5">The median earnings after graduation from Texas Tech could be in the range of $46000 to $55000 depending on the course and the profession. A mechanical engineer may fetch about $57000 while a lawyer may get $74000 and petroleum engineer (as precious as it can get) makes about $90000! On the management side, an operations manager may fetch about $60000. Overall, the placement data shows a 78% placement rate. By the graduation day, at least 45% of the students have a job in their hands, a lot of them settling in the cities such as Dallas, Houston, Lubbock, Austin and San Antonio. Some of the top employers are British Petroleum, Dell, IBM and Tyler Technologies.

</string>
    <string name="uni77_6">With an enrollment of about 36000 students a year, Texas Tech, popularly known as TTU, is definitely a large campus. About 29000 students (45% female and 55% male) are undergraduates and the rest are graduate students. Nearly 2100 students on campus are international students. There are 450 student organizations on campus. Students are proud that a lot of additional resources available at Texas Tech are free of cost and easily accessible. This brings a high student satisfaction rate. One of the uniting factors for the school is the Red Raiders football team (especially when they play against their number 1 rival: Texas A&amp;amp;amp;M). Apart from this, the athletics scene on campus is really intense with TTU attending the Big 12 Conference and competing in 17 varsity sports.
</string>
    <string name="uni77_7">TTU is an interesting contrast. While Lubbock as a city gives a mixed small-town-big-city feeling, while the huge campus with its own historic pride, and classes that can make you feel intimidated. But there’s always a lot to do and a friendly support system available at the stretch of your hand.

    <string name="uni78_1">Established in 1907, University of California at Riverside is a public research university and is counted in one of the 10 general campuses of the University of California system. With the motto ‘Let there be light’ the university has literally made stars out of the students. From it huge campus to great faculty, never has happened that a negative remark was given to the university. But, of course! Every university has its negative along with positive point which will be discussed below.

</string>
    <string name="uni78_2">Here comes the best thing about this university, its infrastructure. Established in a huge 1100 acres of ground, the campus feels like a new world within itself. A clock tower as a landmark in the center, the university is surrounded with green covers and beautiful school buildings which include dorms. UCR has a famous name on citrus groves which is the reason why Citrus groves and row crops occupy the remaining 295 acres (119 ha) stretching northwest to the intersection of Chicago Avenue and Le Conte Drive.

</string>
    <string name="uni78_3">The university recruits the best that is out there to teach their students, but judging the faculty on their qualification just isn’t enough. There have been many complaints of the faculty being unresponsive and rude to students. If you have a doubt, better keep in mind that it is a sensible one or you might feel offended after asking it.

</string>
    <string name="uni78_4">Just like all other universities, UCR promotes scholarships for needy and talented students. The best part at UCR is that due to a limited enrollment there are higher chances of you attaining the scholarship.

</string>
    <string name="uni78_5">Being situated in California, the University has deep connections with the best firms out there. There are in-campus placements being held every year, but that depends on the requirements of the firm as well. If the college of Psychology miss a placement session this year, that doesn’t mean that the same would happen next year.

</string>
    <string name="uni78_6">Living at UCR is like living in all together a new world. The diversity found amongst the students helps one understand different set of values and cultures. Many international students take interest in UCR as it is easy to get into it. The crowd would be humble and enjoying a cup of coffee with your ‘diverse’ friends at the UCR cafeteria is considered as the best time of the college.

</string>
    <string name="uni78_7">It is always difficult to choose a university while studying abroad, as you never have a word of mouth suggestion for it. UCR is best known for its Science and Biology department but lacks at some aspects such as Psychology. Before getting into UCR do get in contact with the alumni to know about your specific course. The campus has its own perks and the university has a deep connection with firms which makes a good point to take admissions there. Think twice before enrolling as the faculty review does not sound good. There are professors who are good, but the majority of the remarks criticize them, else it’s up to your expectations and choice as student.

 //joba, verdict, aid,staff   <string name="uni79_1">IUPUI is Indiana\'s premier urban university, with 19 schools and academic units that grant degrees in more than 200 programs from both Indiana University and Purdue University. IUPUI can trace its roots back to 1891, when Indiana University offered classes in Indianapolis for the very first time. However, the two universities operated independently until then mayor Richard Lugar called for "a great state university in Indianapolis" in 1968. As a result, Indiana University and Purdue University merged their many programs and schools to create Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis in 1969.

</string>
    <string name="uni79_2">Indiana University-Purdue University--Indianapolis offers a number of student services including nonremedial tutoring, women\'s center, placement service, day care, health service, and health insurance. Indiana University-Purdue University--Indianapolis also offers campus safety and security services like 24-hour foot and vehicle patrols, late night transport/escort service, 24-hour emergency telephones, lighted pathways/sidewalks, and controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc).

</string>
    <string name="uni79_3">Besides academics, IUPUI students can get involved in many student organizations, as well as Greek life and intramural sports. Student athletes can try out for the IUPUI Jaguars varsity teams, which compete in the NCAA Division I Summit League. IUPUI also hosts many events for students to attend, including the annual International Festival, which presents foods and crafts from around the world.

    <string name="uni80_1">Johns Hopkins University (JHU) is a private research university located in Baltimore, Maryland. Consistently ranked as one of the top universities for research in the world, JHU is a universal favourite for its medical, biotech engineering and biomedical engineering programs. A little fun fact – more than 33 Nobel Prize winners are in some way associated with the university, either past/present professors or alumni.

</string>
    <string name="uni80_2">Johns Hopkins University is built on a nice 140 acre campus, and once you reach it after driving through Baltimore, it just doesn’t feel like you’re still in the midst of the city. Make no mistake, this is a good thing. The campus is very modern and has all sorts of state-of-the-art facilities, but it also has a peaceful atmosphere thanks to the lush greenery everywhere. JHU is known for its research, and all the libraries, laboratories and research centers more than do justice to the Hopkins name.

</string>
    <string name="uni80_3">Students are pretty pleased with the academics at Johns Hopkins. In fact, that’s probably the main reason why they joined it. JHU is regarded as the best in the world for medicine, and that is perhaps why even the biomed and biotech engineering courses are so impressive. Although the quality of the professors cannot be questioned, students always complain that they are more bothered about their research than actually teaching in classes. This makes the professors slightly unapproachable at times, but then again they are willing to go out of their way if you build a good rapport with them.

</string>
    <string name="uni80_4">Since it’s a private university, they aren’t terribly generous with freeships, but fortunately you can get excellent Teaching Assistantships and Research Assistantships at JHU.

</string>
    <string name="uni80_5">Since the college is so well known for its medicine-related fields, most of the people you’ll come across are those typical ‘I have donated my life to saving other lives’ types. Okay, not really – it’s not THAT bad. But well it isn’t too great either. You’ll find a nice, healthy ratio of males to females, but don’t expect to see supermodels. Most students are really studious, and perhaps too sincere. But having said that, you can still make some good friends, no doubt.

All in all, it’s quite a fantastic learning experience here.

</string>
    <string name="uni81_4">Scholarships aren’t terribly easy to come by, but it’s not too hard to get one either. You have to maintain decent acads though, so you’ll find a number of students applying for RAs and TAs instead.

</string>
    <string name="uni81_5">This really is what ‘university life’ is all about. A small college town, a number of colleges, thousands of fellow students, and the freedom to make your own decisions. Many students prefer going to a college in a big city, to get a taste of the ‘American Urban Life’, but if you want to know what a university should be like, this is where to start. A highly diverse crowd has students from all walks of life, and it’s never hard to find people to get along with. It’s a wonderful experience at one of the best places to be on the East Coast.

    <string name="uni83_1">George Washington University is a private research university located in Washington DC, which is it\'s USP if you ask us. Founded in 1821, GWU is one of the universities most average students apply to, so that they can at least study in an awesome city if not such an awesome university.

</string>
    <string name="uni83_2">The surprising thing here is that although he\'ll of a lot of money is spent on facilities, the basic infrastructure - lecture halls, classrooms, laboratories - aren\'t exactly up to the mark. Everything else though, is quite exceptional. They have brilliant facilities for all sports and athletics, a huge library which has everything you could need, and a great, state of the art gym.

</string>
    <string name="uni83_3">Now, George Washington University is by no means among the top universities in the States, especially for engineering. Somehow, though, the professors here are quite fantastic - highly qualified and highly experienced. It doesn\'t take a rocket scientist to figure out the reason - DC, if you were still wondering. Professors share a good rapport with students, though sometimes it becomes difficult to get personal attention, simply because of the sizes of the classes.

</string>
    <string name="uni83_4">At a college that charges a frightfully high fee, you\'d expect some amount of decency when it comes to scholarships. Apparently not, it seems. Yes, it\'s possible to get some funding, but it\'s never easy, unless you have a strong (academic) case for it.

</string>
    <string name="uni83_5">You dont have to be TOO worried about finding a job, but if you want to worry about something, it might be smart to start with your academics. You\'re definitely going to have a harder time looking for a job if you have awful marks than if you\'re a topper, so that\'s something you should aim for. Everything else falls into place automatically, since they have quite a decent Career Centre, which provides high quality guidance and help.

</string>
    <string name="uni83_6">You wont find a great big number of Indians here, for two reasons - one, it\'s not that great a university. Two, it\'s bloody expensive. That\'s a dangerous combination which sends it tumbling down the Indian Ranking System. However, you\'ll still find a fair few Indians, who\'ve come here simply for the DC tag (just like you might, if you end up there). And fair enough, because there\'s some great cultural, social, and religious diversity here. Washington DC after all.
</string>
    <string name="uni83_7">If your aim is a big city rather than a big college, George Washington University is pretty much made for you. Though you could probably aim for some better colleges in New York anyway.

    <string name="uni84_1">Established in 1965, UCSC is a public- collegiate research university and is one of 10 campuses in the University of California system. Being associated with one of the most famous university branch, this specific university has proved to be different in many ways. With the collaboration of huge campus and beautiful location, this university has never failed to produce good alumni.

</string>
    <string name="uni84_2">A vast campus of 2000 acres is something worth an experience. Between the Pacific Ocean and Santa Cruz mountain range lies this beautiful campus of UCSC. The campus is so big that the difference between the elevation of the entrance gate and the last point of the campus is almost of 900Ft. Apart from the college buildings, the campus has a beautiful ‘walk in the jungle’ feature, where any student can go to spend some time and breathe in the fresh air. The McHenry library has a ‘fall into affair’ infrastructure for all the literature lovers.

</string>
    <string name="uni84_3">Faculty at UCSC can be described as ‘chilled out’ in the official California language. Once you are in UCSC it would be very easy for you to understand that everybody in the campus is a stoner. Sometimes it is difficult to judge whether a faculty has read eye because of lack of sleep or his ‘weed-addiction’. Usually the faculty recruited comes with a great qualification, their addiction does not change their approach towards teaching methods.

</string>
    <string name="uni84_4">UCSC conducts few scholarship programs which help students attaint their graduation without thinking about the fee. The only problem that there are very few such opportunities, so one must keep a track of their website and keep enquiring about it.

</string>
    <string name="uni84_5">There have been rumors that the university had increased their enrollment using the name of firms they would get their students into after graduation. Once or twice the university has failed to conduct placements, but as per their rules they always conduct them. Whether you get a job or not completely depend on your grades and achievements, so work hard on them.

</string>
    <string name="uni84_6">When the university offers you 2000 acres of land to study at, then you must leave the process of making memories to the campus. The people are down to earth and most of them belong to rich families. The only thing you must get used to is the official dose of California and that is weed.

</string>
    <string name="uni84_7">The final statement would be if you are looking for a good agricultural college and some fun, then UCSC is a good option to look forward too. Arts department is not considered that rich with values. If you are an open minded student and looking for a serious career in a specific field, then UCSC is not the place to go to. If you consider the other departments such as engineering and agriculture, then you can give a sneak a little into the admission process.

The staff reportedly has a passionate commitment towards teaching. They are warm, approachable and extremely helpful towards their students.

</string>
    <string name="uni86_4">The tuition fee is a trifle steep for out of state students, but K-State offers various types of loans, financial assistance along with opportunities to work on the campus. The University allocates over $200 million annually for work study, scholarships, student loans and grants.

</string>
    <string name="uni86_5">The job placement is fairly good with most students landing jobs after graduating. The Career and Employment Services in the Institute assist scholars in honing up their interviewing and resume-writing skills. Additionally, the campus organizes career fairs to help students find lucrative employment. Many university graduates are working in Texas and California with some have also gained employment abroad.

</string>
    <string name="uni86_6">The K-State campus has tons of fun and extra-curricular activities going on. There is something for every kind of student, from shy to extrovert, in-state to international. There are a plethora of fraternities and sororities, clubs, and organizations along with a student government which makes it easy for all kinds of people to fit.

    <string name="uni87_1">Duke University is a private research university located in Durham, North Carolina. While certainly more popular for its management and medical courses, Duke is quite a handful even when it comes to engineering, and certainly ranks amongst the top 50 for all the fields if offers. That, if you’re wondering, is pretty good.

</string>
    <string name="uni87_2">If the size of the campus (8000 acres) isn’t enough to make your mouth water, then the splendid Gothic architecture certainly will be. Within the campus lies the beautiful Duke Forest; no, it isn’t a ‘jungle’ – wild animals won’t appear out of nowhere and skin you to death – it’s a private research forest, which is a really cool thing. To call the buildings, well, ‘buildings’, would be doing a disservice to architecture, since these are definitely palaces. But as antique (in a good way) they might look from the outside, you’ll be surprised, and pretty pleased, to know that they are absolutely state-of-the-art from the inside. Fantastic laboratories, athletic facilities and lecture halls and complemented by the massive library system, which has over 6 million volumes in all!

</string>
    <string name="uni87_3">Although Duke has earned its reputation primarily due to its medical programs, the Pratt School of Engineering (that’s where you engineers will land up) isn’t lagging too far behind. Professors are highly knowledgeable, and are always willing to help students, provided the initiative comes from the correct side. And if you’re a biomedical student, getting into Duke is akin to striking gold, since you’ll be getting access to the medical school’s facilities, and being taught a number of courses by their professors.

</string>
    <string name="uni87_4">Being a private university, Duke isn’t what you would call ‘generous’ with its scholarships, but if you have acads to back your need, you could get lucky.

</string>
    <string name="uni87_5">Although in today’s times, no one is ever guaranteed an excellent job, you can certainly get an edge over the others if you quickly get in touch with the Career Center at Duke. Building up your resume and keeping your academic levels high really go a long way in ensuring you get a top job. Companies like Accenture and Google do hire from Duke, but you need to be that good.

</string>
    <string name="uni87_6">Now, the scene at Duke is pretty much similar to what you see in India. Hardly any women do engineering, and even the ones who do aren’t exactly hot, to say the least. However, just like in India, the best girls take up medicine, and that’s exactly why you shouldn’t limit yourself to the School of Engineering. Roam around, get to know more people, and make sure you find some eye candy in the MedSchool. It’s not hard, really.
</string>
    <string name="uni87_7">Excellent college for Biomed students, and not at all a bad option even for others.</string>

Surrounded by tree-lined residential blocks just minutes away from Philadelphias downtown Center City district, Drexel makes its home in the neighborhood of University City. The city is, however, dirty and its infrastructure is crumbling and decaying all around town. The cultural districts are small and surrounded by areas that lack culture and in many cases, are unsafe. Many of the quaint historic neighborhoods quickly blend into higher crime areas and run-down neighborhoods.

    <string name="uni97_1">University of Houston, Clear Lake (UHCL) is an independent sister University of the University of Houston. It was founded in 1974 and is set in a 530 acre campus at Pasadena in Texas. Do not confuse UHCL with UH as both are separate degree granting entities although part of the same parent system.

</string>
    <string name="uni97_2">UHCL is located in Clear Lake City of Pasadena in very close proximity to Houston. The University is a stone’s throw away from the vast American coastline. Austin in Texas is a 3 hour drive from the campus while even Dallas is just over 4 hours away from Clear Lake city. The campus is hardly any distance to the Clear Lake which exits into the shore. Houston by itself is a very popular and populous city in the USA. Students, after moving in will get the feel of staying in the outskirts of the dream American city. There is tremendous amount of flora and fauna in Clear Lake that disappears gradually as you move into Houston proper. The location is actually pretty awesome giving you a pleasant feel of the nature and of course, the city is right there.

    </string>
    <string name="uni97_4">It is not a difficult task to secure some financial aid in UHCL. You can avail the University grants or the scholarships (they prefer Natives for Scholarships) facility on merit or work part time in campus to meet your expenses. Moreover, the fee and expenses in UHCL won’t be as great as it would have been in another city campus.UHCL has had the distinction of producing several astronauts even with its late inception.

    </string>
    <string name="uni97_5">There is no in campus housing as such. The University helps students to put up at their partner apartments near the campus which is as good as staying off campus. So do not expect anything extravagant but yes, all basic facilities are up to the mark and fresher’s end up staying at the assisted apartments sharing one to three students per allotment. There are plenty of places to stay in close proximity to the Campus and also very reasonably priced with all the freedom one can have. Also, it is a suburb which makes it really safe and accessible place to stay.
    </string>
    <string name="uni97_6">UHCL has great faculty but not as good as UH. As the University is a small one with students per class also less, a lot of attention is given to each students. This stands out for the University as a plus point. Also, the college has a lot of options in courses pertaining to Computers and Information technology which has broadened the faculty of computers for the students.
    </string>
    <string name="uni97_7">Placements at UHCL are very standard and the University doesn’t have much to offer. During a slack period one senses utter problems with jobs and placements while the general trend is to seek what you want. Assistance in the form of alumni interaction is not great considering that fact that the Institute is newer. One can, however, make the best use of whatever guidance the University provides.

    <string name="uni98_1">Founded in 1868, Wayne State University (WSU) is an American public research university located in Detroit, Michigan. WSU consists of 13 schools and colleges offering more than 380 programs to nearly 28,000 graduate and undergraduate students. It is currently Michigan\'s third-largest university and one of the 100 largest universities in the United States. It also has six extension centers in the metro Detroit area providing access to a limited selection of courses. The institution is a notable engine in metro Detroits educational, cultural and economic landscape, as manifested through efforts incorporated in extracurricular activities such as its thriving research and Technology Park and hosting of the Detroit Windsor International Film Festival.
    </string>
    <string name="uni98_2">Detroit is the fourth-largest city in the Midwest and the largest city on the United States–Canada border. It is also amongst the most populous city in the U.S. state of Michigan. Detroit\'s metropolitan area, known as Metro Detroit, is home to 5.3 million people. Connected with all kind of transport ways, Detroit stands as the most important city in the history of mankind. Living in Detroit is like living in brotherhood of New York, it’s just the name the changes else everything feels the same. With a population of 5,700,000 one would never feel isolated in this city. The clubs- bars and parks to roam around are never ending. Three years of graduation might pass away in parties and one would never notice the time.
    </string>

    <string name="uni98_3">The on-campus housing cost for a typical student was $5,723 as per 2014 - 2015 censuses and the cost for a typical meal plan was $3,390 which are affordable compared to other state’s universities. Living on campus is easy and makes your routine better than living off campus would. There are strict rules but they are genuinely helpful in keeping track of time. University does not help in getting off campus settlements; as they are expensive plus travelling expenses if calculated add up to the similar cost as the university charges. So, better would be living on campus as you will save time and reach your class on time.
    </string>
    <string name="uni98_4">Faculty at WSU is good at an average. The university has selected faculty on the basis of their experience and not education. There is a little bit of chaos in faculty approval, there are few professors who have been assigned to wrong subjects due to complaints of students. There will be times that an engineering faculty might come to teach you research analysis as they lack faculty backup most times. Faculty at medical is considered as genuinely good and they are responsive to every student’s doubt.
    </string>
    <string name="uni98_5">If you are a graduate from this university and you’re looking for jobs then do not expect to get a job by the logo on top of your certificate, the university does not have that good name. The university conducts in campus recruitment but preferring them would be a mistake so search for a job by own contacts. Even if 73% of the people are happily employed as per the census, you should be aware of the fact that you wouldn’t be paid that well as compared to the graduates from other universities. Starting annual salary at an average for a graduate from WSU is $35,157 and $65,000 is 10 Year annual salary.
    </string>
    <string name="uni98_6">Detroit is hub of crimes and you might hear the rumors that students in the university are more of criminals than future seekers. But, the rumors cannot be evaluated until one experiences it. There are few students who believe that they have found best of their friends in WSU. The campus has registered a lot of complaints about robbery and eve tease, who did that no one knows. Administration acts like a mediator from students to the top faculty and they tend to take advantage of this situation by being rude to either of them. There are ego problems for sure in this university but if you be good, then everyone tends to be good towards you.
    </string>
    <string name="uni98_7">Looking at the affordability, one can say that the university is worth a try but if you are willing to pay something more; you can go for similar but at a little expensive rates. It is difficult to judge a scenario from outside specifically about the rumors on crimes until you experience them, if a doubt it raised then you should reconsider living on-campus. Administration can be a problem, taking admissions in this university is a task but once you are in then you should be able to face more such problems. The university is accused of charging hidden prices for everything, the books are special edition of the university and for which you are charged more than other sources. The outcome of the university is not that bad, but if you have any doubts or if you can afford more money you should think twice before applying here.

An umbrella is needed sometimes if you wish to take a long walk around the campus.Sacramento has abundant plant life, so here is a caution line.

Created in 1967 by the amalgamation of the Case Institute of Technology and the Western Reserve University, CWRU is consistently ranked among the top 50 universities in the United States. Although it’s an excellent school for just about any course, special mention of its Biomedical program must be made. If you’re a Biomed/Biotech student, Case Western should definitely be one of your top picks.</string>
    <string name="uni101_2">Though Cleveland is a rather nice city even by itself, and you should find anything and everything you need right here, there are a number of places to visit even once you get out. Detroit and Pittsburgh are both 2-3 hours away by road, while downtown Cleveland is just a 20 minute walk away.

</string>
    <string name="uni101_3">If you’re doing your Masters at Case Western, there’s a good chance that you’ll be living off campus, since that’s where most grad students end up. It’s cheaper, it’s more luxurious, and it certainly gives you far more privacy than living in dorms. Some of the popular areas students move into are Cleveland Heights, Little Italy, Cedar-Fairmount and Hessler. Of course, once you explore a bit, it’ll be clear which ones are affordable and which ones aren’t, but you can be sure of getting more-than-acceptable housing provided you’re willing to share an apartment (and thus also share the rent).

But the worst part about the climate is definitely its unpredictability – weather forecasts are completely useless, you never know what to expect. Students say they get used to it eventually, and while they can’t exactly enjoy it, at least they learn to deal with it.

</string>
    <string name="uni101_5">One thing that you can be sure of at Case is highly knowledgeable, dedicated and passionate professors. The university is involved in very high levels of research activity, and students get more than a fair chance to be part of it. Professors ensure that they encourage students and mentor them in a way that would never be forgotten. But you must bear in mind that the learning process isn’t ever one-way-traffic. Students need to take the initiative, make the first move, develop a rapport. Then you can sit back and watch as the brilliant faculty shapes your academic life into something very, very meaningful.

</string>
    <string name="uni101_6">While it isn’t impossible, by any means, to get some strong scholarships, it’s made slightly difficult by the fact that CWRU is a private university. TAs and RAs are relatively simple to get, but you should aim at applying for (and being worth) some sort of financial aid.

</string>
    <string name="uni101_7">It’s widely regarded as the next best thing to Mecca for Biomed students, and pretty good for most other courses too, which is why it should definitely be in your sights if you have an average profile.

Although the University is most famous for its school of music, the Hajim School of Engineering and Applied Sciences with its Biomedical Sciences and Engineering course being the most preferred is part of the campus of around 700 acres.

</string>
    <string name="uni105_2">The University is a 10-15 minute drive from the city of Rochester. The immediate surroundings are not very happening but surely everybody loves it for it is peaceful and quiet. Most of the area always has students around and there are a number of calm places to hang out like the parks or the riverside. Niagara falls are a couple of hours from the campus and Toronto too is a few hours drive from the campus. Students can complain about the quietness of the small city, but if that’s what you like, nothing like Rochester!

</string>
    <string name="uni105_3">The Rochester campus is small but facilities are decent. Both the libraries are liked by the students and the gymnasium is one of the favourite of the students in UR.

</string>
    <string name="uni105_4">Well, on campus residing options are limited and not really in your control. Dorms are allotted in groups of two and sometimes (rare) in groups of three.

</string>
    <string name="uni105_6">Getting financial aid at UR is rather easy. Everybody gets some kind of aid but to secure a good financial waive off one should be at par in the merit. Up to 70% of the tuition fee can be waived off with the help of the institutional financial aid facility but well, of course you need to be good enough to deserve so!

</string>
    <string name="uni105_7">Academics and the curriculum at Rochester is certainly top notch; if you can bear the extremely difficult weather and remain away from the city life in peace, UR is the right place to be.

</string>
    <string name="uni106_4">It’s not too hard to get some kind of scholarship, especially if you have respectable academics to back yourself.

</string>
    As in any other university, there’s a decent mix of students from various cultural and economic backgrounds, but you’ll definitely be able to find your place here. There’s not a terrible amount to do near college, and that’s probably why they have three pretty cool bars on campus. Thirsty Dog and Huskies are the two more popular ones, though Ted’s is the place to be if you’re a sports lover. Other than that, there are millions of parties every night, but you just have to find the right places, for which you’ll need to find the right people.


    <string name="uni106_6">One of the colleges an average student applies to, but University of Connecticut is certainly not a university you should put at the top of your list.

    <string name="uni113_1">Princeton University is a Private Ivy League research university founded in the year 1746. It was set up by the British colonial rulers even before America could gain independence. Over the years, Princeton has gone on to produce students who have gone on to become world leaders, great scientists and inventors. It is, arguably, one of the best universities across the planet. All these reasons have led to Princeton having an ultra-low intake level, so we guess most of y’all are reading this review purely for knowledge and entertainment sake. Jokes apart, every top ranker from the top Indian or Asians universities keeps Princeton as a dream option which means the chances of an admit are next to zero, of course.

</string>
    <string name="uni113_2">The Princeton University campus is spread over 500 acres. The oldest building, the Nassau Hall was constructed in 1756 (Before your great-great-grandfather was born). There are a number of towers and theatres across campus all with breathtakingly beautiful architecture. Most of them are over a century old and have withstood the test of time. At Princeton, the quality of infrastructure is never a cause of concern. It is simply the best.

</string>
    <string name="uni113_3">Princeton did not become one of the most sought after universities overnight. One of the major reasons why it has reached the top notch level is because of the fantastic faculty. Most of them are recipients of numerous awards ranging from the Nobel Prize to the Pulitzer Prize and even some who have won the Emmy Award (in their own field). Most of them are into cutting-edge research and any kind of association with them will surely be a big boost to your academic experience and knowledge.

</string>
    <string name="uni113_4">Let’s first think about getting an admit here, then consider applying for any sort of aid or assistantship. However, if you do make it to Princeton, getting an external scholarship won’t be that difficult because that admit will be your ticket to going places.

</string>
    <string name="uni113_5">If anyone is questioning this parameter at Princeton is a big fool. Once you are a Princeton grad, start-ups, MNCs, conglomerates and headhunters alike will be lining up to recruit you.

</string>
    <string name="uni113_6">When you go at Princeton, rather if you do, then you will surely be surrounded by the best-of-the-best in their field. So, obviously you can’t expect the most raging party scene. Students prefer to stay indoors here. However, there will be some parties going on here-and-there, mostly gatherings on the streets or small house parties.
</string>
    <string name="uni113_7">The probability of you getting into Princeton University is as low as the value of “e raise to the power of minus infinity". While 99% students do not consider this university because of the terrible intake, extremely high tuition fee and the but obivous decision REJECT, we suggest the remaining brave, smart, extremely talented, meritorious 1% students to take their chances. It certainly stands out as the best university in the world and a degree from here will change your fortune hundred-folds.

</string>
    <string name="uni115_7">The university has a good name and discipline, the only problem here is the awkward behavior put forward by professors. Some professors are willing to help immediately while others will tell you to solve it yourself. Let us put forward an advice, the 2010 shooting case is something not to consider while taking admissions in the university even if everybody keeps telling you about it, which was not university\’s fault. Do not go on the false impression of people, present your own judgement and follow the process.

There are consecutive sequences of issues between faculty and students. Call it ego clash or anything. As per few students the faculty is rude and irresponsible as they teach from the books of old syllabus while the university provides them with books of new syllabus. There have been such problems and university has tried to work on it every time, but they fail.

</string>
    <string name="uni117_4">Just like other Universities of Colorado this university provides with carious kind of financial aids. There are no specific scholarships announced regularly.</string>

If there are problems happening amongst the students and faculty, then you must evaluate the situation first and then think about applying. The place has a good environment for study. The town has a good population but you would never hear the traffic sound. The only way to win in this university is by showing off your hard-work to the professors.

The university is known for its medical campus and it has a good name amongst competitive universities. Managing 18,000 students sounds like a mess, but the campus blocks and buildings are so well managed that you don’t feel that you are studying with 18,000 other students. Peace and silence is something well cared of in this university. Apart from all these the university’s canteen is something worth a visit. The food at the canteen in campus is tasty and worth a try, sometimes students miss their class to eat day’s special dishes.

</string>
    <string name="uni118_3">Faculty at Wright State University is considered as well experienced and they have good amount of knowledge which they share with great interest.

You will get new friends such as library and canteen and rarely will you see a group laughing out loud and having a time of their life. Now you must be expecting that weekends would be a bang to your boring weekdays then please hold your thought and don’t raise your expectations as weekends are equally dull and sometimes worse cause of the fact that you expect some fun. Other fellow students love reading and hate talking so making a friend might get difficult.

</string>
    <string name="uni118_7">If you are looking for some budget education and want to make a not so famous and ‘living in the country’ sort of career then please ignore this university. The university has some good professors but eventually if you want to be someone known this university’s name wouldn\’t help you in that, hard work and luck will. Many students have complained that teachers are lenient and pay less attention during exam days which eventually lead to easy question papers and less competition. This is the first time ever someone has complaints about easy paper by which you can understand how studios the students there might be. As a conclusion this place is definitely affordable and if you are looking for simply a foreign degree which has nothing but studies as its primary motive then this university is the one for you.

    <string name="uni119_5">It is extremely cold for about 1-2 months of the year (when it snows) while the rest of the days, the mercury is more than bearable. But in Kansas it isn’t the temperature which is a headache, it is the erratic weather. It is sunny one moment and at another it rains. It is windy in Wichita and you will repeatedly see storms and tornadoes which becomes increasingly irritating most times.

    <string name="uni121_7">The University of Oklahoma is a respected university, but it is difficult to find balance between sports and academics here. If you wish to excel in both then you must have a great schedule which is difficult to follow due to extra-curricular activities. The university tries to keep you busy all the time and sports is one such event which you can’t miss. If you wish to be into studies then concentrate wholly on that, but your social life won’t have any point if you act like a bookworm. If you wish to make a career in sports or government job then this university gives you quite an exposure for that, else being studious one just doesn’t help here.

    <string name="uni122_1">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is a private research university located in the city of Troy, New York. RPI, as it’s commonly called, was founded in 1824 and is one of the oldest technological universities in the States. Ranked moderately among the top 50 schools in USA, Rensselaer is a well known college for Electrical, Computer and Financial courses. However, it isn\'t too popular among Indians; the only ones who end up here, do so because of it\'s proximity to New York, and nothing else.

</string>
    <string name="uni122_2">The RPI campus is spread over 275 acres and has an amazing blend of modern and traditional architecture. The college buildings tend to lack the aesthetic appeal though students often boast about the modern architecture. The Folsom Library which is the main library has truckloads of books and thousands of volumes of all the possible courses offered in the university. There are multiple cafés on the campus followed by clubhouse which is the drinking place, thus the most crowded place. The facilities at Rensselaer are excellent as it comprises a fitness centre, swimming pool, basketball court, weightlifting court, etc.

</string>
    <string name="uni122_3">Almost all the teachers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute have completed their Ph.D degrees from high ranking schools in the States. Most of them have crazy multiple degrees. Professors are extremely well versed with their subject and students make sure that they attend all the lectures. Seniors say that it’s advisable not to mess around with a few teachers especially the senior professors. At RPI students can expect rigorous studies both inside and outside the lecture halls owing to the strictness of the faculty and too much course work. Some students complain about the professors being engaged in their respective thesis and research work but they are still quite approachable when it comes to doubts and problem solving.

</string>
    <string name="uni122_4">Scholarships at RPI are very difficult unless you’ve a mind blowing profile which impresses the admission committee. Owing to the private funded nature of the university, financial aid is certainly tough to get. If you maintain your academic scores and are up-to-date with your assignment work, Research Assistantship and Teaching Assistantship are gettable, but don\'t count on anything.

</string>
    <string name="uni122_5">The biggest advantage at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is its strategic location. New York certainly has the maximum number of MNC’s in the States along with California and Chicago. GE, IBM, Procter &amp; Gamble are the major recruiters at RPI. Students have to apply to the company of their choice in the career fair. Better the profile, better are the placements. Definitely, higher is the pay package.

</string>
    <string name="uni122_6">RPI quite clearly has more number of boys than girls. The ratio would be anything around 4:1. Girls enjoy the liberty of having more boys in the campus and the sex ratio is a very common topic of complaint in this university. You can expect to meet students from various regions of USA and other parts of the world. Indians are a handful, though most of the people are white.
</string>
    <string name="uni122_7">Firstly, its not a great college. Secondly, its not in New York City. If you\'re still considering it, you probably don\'t have a choice.

    <string name="uni123_1">University of Illinois, Spring Field is a Public University established in 1969 and was incorporated into the University of Illinois system in 1995. The college is in fact popular for its liberal arts courses while a couple of specialized master’s programmes are offered too.

</string>
    <string name="uni123_2">Infrastructure in UIS is really good. All facilities are up to date and liked by students. There are several of community interaction centers that students become beneficiaries of. There is a lot of greenery in and around the campus which makes it really beautiful. The only concern is the fact that there isn’t much of engineering infrastructure. The university provides for only few specialized engineering courses which make it less favourable for the engineering students.

</string>
    <string name="uni123_3">With the Faculty to student ratio being 1:14, the students find the class sizes bearable. The faculty is known to be knowledgeable from across various fields. The most popular majors are Computer Science, Business Administration and Management and Computer Systems Analyst. Interestingly the online courses provided by the university (especially Computer Science) is valued greatly and is highly appreciated. Students take these online courses to even get a leap in their careers. Popular professors in the university are Anne Strahle (Communication), David Bertania (History), Elham Khorasani (Computer Science), etc.

</string>
    <string name="uni123_4">One of the plus points at University of Illinois is the low tuition fees. The tuition fees for residents is $9405 and for non-residents, it $18000. Official reports mention that the average need based scholarship given is $10,000. Nearly 70% of the students receive financial aid of one or other form Apart from this, there are various jobs on campus like working as a teaching assistant or at various places on campus graduate Assistantships are available for an average of $ 8 per hour pay.

</string>
    <string name="uni123_5">The career center helps students with various levels of guidance during job searches. However, the median starting salary is low at $42600 which is one of the downsides of the university. The mid career salary may go to about $80,000. Some of the biggest companies/organizations recruit from the campus, like Walt Disney, Frazier Industrial, State of Illinois, State Farm Insurance Company, Accenture, Deloitte, General Electric, etc.

</string>
    <string name="uni123_6">With a small cohort of total 5428 students, there are 2959 undergraduates, 2469 (3.8% Asians) graduates. The gender ratio is rather balanced with 49% male and 51% female students. There are various efforts for group integration and group fitness regimes. One can find short courses on sports such as Putt-Putt too. The university plays for NCAA Division II (competing in 10 sports) with the basketball team known as Illinois-Springfield Prairie Stars. The campus radio serves as a working laboratory for experiential learning. There is also a student newspaper called The Journal. Students find the campus supportive of the diversity but the downsides may be that the social life is weak especially because it is a midsize city.

</string>
    <string name="uni123_7">It is a university which has a potential of becoming a vibrant campus but gets hindered by its location, more commuters, no parking and small budgets. Located in a midsize city, U of Illinois gives you a tolerable temperature and good classes at a lower tuition fee, although the lower median salary is definitely a deterrent. The highest salaries would surely be significant and if you are in the MS in CS program, you have nothing to worry about. It may not be the best (compared to some of the other public universities in Illinois) but being a big fish in a small pond may have merits too.

    <string name="uni124_1">Yale University is a private Ivy League research university in New Haven, Connecticut. It was founded in 1701 as the "Collegiate School" by a group of Congregationalist ministers Yale University comprises three major academic components: Yale College (the undergraduate program), the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the professional schools. In addition, Yale encompasses a wide array of centers and programs, libraries, museums, and administrative support offices. Approximately 11,250 students attend Yale.

</string>
    <string name="uni124_2">The central campus is located in downtown New Haven and is spread across 260 acres which include its main, historic campus and the medical campus.Known particularly for its Gothic Style architecture, it has stone sculptures depicting various prestigious college personalities. Acid was splashed on the building walls to make them look older. Some of the examples of Gothic style buildings are Vanderbilt Hall, Phelps Hall, St. Anthony Hall, etc which may give a huge sense of Harry Potter\'s Hogwarts but not all of Yale looks like that. The oldest building on campus is the Connecticut Hall (1750) which was built in the Georgian style.
</string>
    <string name="uni124_3">With a total of 4410 faculty members, Yale has a faculty to student ratio of 1:6 that is enough to get you awestruck and over 75% of their classes have fewer than 20 students which means great one-on-one learning. The classes can be rigorous and stressful. All the departments are equally stressful and equally good. Some of the known professors on campus are Ramamurti Shankar (Physics), Joanne Freeman (History), Ralph Selig (Mathematics), Marc Lapadula (Film), etc.

</string>
    <string name="uni124_4">Average grant-in-aid received is about dollar 43000. Yale claims that Financial aid is available to all of its students regardless of their citizenship. 73 percent of the MBA students get need based financial aid. There are also 11 entrepreneurial fellowships available. Nevertheless, the competition for this scholarship is very high. There are also various opportunities for employment on campus.

</string>
    <string name="uni124_5">Being one of the top 3 colleges in the country, Yale has a very high return on investment. The median salary made by a Yale graduate is roughly $66000 but the average rises in private sector ($84000). All of the known big companies recruit Yale students. Mid-career pay of someone who studied at Yale would be roughly $132000. The highest chosen sectors by Yale students are Business Consulting (29 percent) and Non-Profits (25 percent).

</string>
    <string name="uni124_6">Having over 5453 undergraduate students and 6869 graduate students, Yale is one of those very few universities with more number of grads that undergrads on campus. The campus has about 4400 international students from across 118 countries. In terms of gender diversity, 49% of the students are male and 51% are female. Yale has 35 varsity sports teams. On the western part of New Haven, the university holds another 500 acres of athletic facilities, including the Yale Golf Course.
</string>
    <string name="uni124_7">The only problem that you may face with Yale is getting accepted over there. For every 100 applications, they accept only 7, which makes the fight very tight. Apart from that, the place will make you work very hard and you ought to be cautious and be safe outside campus. Students also recommend that you maintain a good study-life balance.

The campus consists of 1,100 acres of total area which is huge in terms of its establishment. Due to its historical construction the campus itself has few historical monuments which are considered as heritage now. The infrastructure feels like a new era all together. The campus has numerous libraries few of which are; the Watson Library, Spencer Research Library, and Anschutz Library, which commemorates the businessman Philip Anschutz, an alumnus of the University.

</string>
    <string name="uni126_3">The faculty at UK takes every course pretty seriously. If the students tend to question the teaching process of professors then there are chances of an argument heating up. The teachers are considered as adamant and rude. Even if they are responsive to the student’s doubts, they teach more unrelated stuff to students. There have been cases that students have complained about teachers spending more time on teaching stuff that was not related to the syllabus and the radar has moved so far that teachers sometimes talk about sports and leave the books aside for which few scholar students have complaints on.

</string>
    <string name="uni126_4">The university has provided a special administration for financial aid office which is away from the main university administration. This process helps to diminish the politics between both the offices as there is no contact between them and student gets to avail better concessions. The university conducts scholarships for which one must have good GRE grades. Apart from that your caste and creed are considered at times along with the annual income of your family.

</string>
    <string name="uni126_5">The university has a good name among the firms due to its historical element and notable alumni. There is no doubt that a graduation certificate from this university wouldn’t land you at no man’s land. The university conducts placement exams for which you must have a good remark on your character and high grades which is compulsory in almost all universities.

</string>
    <string name="uni126_6">If you are UK then all you will get to hear about is the sport event that is forthcoming or about to happen any time soon. The students do not have an eye beyond the sports event. If you are a sports freak and love watching any kind of sport even if it is a thumb fight then you will be accepted by everybody or else you might be friend-zoned or abandoned. The students have nothing else to talk apart from sports as Kansas is a small place and everybody knows each other because the whole city meets at the sport event. There are possibilities that your teacher isn’t in class today because he has a sport event to attend, specifically football. The town has a band name in case of international students. They would merely appreciate your talent and might be racist towards you.

</string>
    <string name="uni126_7">In the end if you aren’t a sports fan then you must keep on checking the university list because your life at UK might get worse. Other than that the engineering college of this university is pretty famous and they have a good faculty for that but again if your sports knowledge is low then you might have to bare few taunts and that might just ruin your few years unless you are a complete nerd. The university a lot to offer apart from just courses, you just need to have an eye for that.

    <string name="uni128_1">University of Missouri is a public research university located in the U.S. state of Missouri. The university was established in 1839 and it’s the largest university in Missouri, MU enrolls 35,441 students offering over 300 degree programs in 19 academic colleges in the 2014–15 year. It is considered as a ‘royal’ university and its status would cause a lot of trouble to you for managing a seat there.

</string>
    <string name="uni128_2"></string>
    <string name="uni128_3">Professors at MU can be compared to one of the best in US. There are high chances that you might end up learning from a Noble prize nominee or attend a guest lecture at least. The only issue that might concern you is strictness. The university follows a lot of rules and asks their professor to do the same. If you are a ‘wind in my hair’ person and like to live free then this is definitely not the university for you.

</string>
    <string name="uni128_4">The university prefers students with good academic background and the only thing that can get you in is its entrance exam. If you pass that exam then only you can avail the specific kind of scholarship that is provided, else the university does not conduct exams for such scholarships.

</string>
    <string name="uni128_5">If you are at MU then there is a 90% chance that you will get placed somewhere by the end of the year and that wholly depends on how you kept your repo with teachers. Teachers hold a good ‘last decision’ power and you cannot change it if your behavior has offended them in any way.

</string>
    <string name="uni128_6">Scholars, studious and book worms that’s all the kind you’ll find in this university. Rarely will you find someone talking about the weekend rugby match and not looking at the book. The point is that there is time for everything at MU and it is scheduled well within the campus fences, so if you have already got into MU then you must be prepared for this strict schedule which includes your thought restriction too.

</string>
    <string name="uni128_7">There is discipline and a structure, one who denies following them must reconsider some other university. There is a possibility that even a small argument with professor can be risky for your future. The university provides good quality of education, studies aren’t that stressful but the regulations are. The university is not completely into academics, it gives a mere amount of importance to sports as well. You might get busy and won’t have time to chill with your friends, but then the outcome is worth it. If rules aren’t the kind of life you follow then you must consider some other university.

    <string name="uni129_1">Founded 126 years ago in 1890, Washington State University (WSU) is a public research university based in Pullman, Washington, in the Palouse region of the northwest United States. It is ranked in the top 140 universities in America with high research activity, as determined by the U.S. News &amp; World Report and undoubtedly any student will apply in this university just by looking at its name. With an enrollment of 30,000 students it is the state\'s land-grant university, well known for its programs in chemical engineering, veterinary medicine, agriculture, pharmacy, neuroscience, food science, plant science, business, architecture, and communications.

</string>
    <string name="uni129_2">WSU is like a country within itself. With an enormous campus of 650 acres the university stands over a hill with a unique style of wearing heritage value. The construction is old yet maintained pretty well, the administration building is an eye-catcher and the clock tower gives a feel as if you are living in a whole new era.

</string>
    <string name="uni129_3">It is difficult to talk about faculty as a group. It’s impossible that there are no negative remarks against faculty of any specific university. In case of WSU the faculties of few colleges are considered as remarkable. WSU has one of the best faculties at their geology and engineering colleges. Often students take admissions in WSU as thinking that they are getting admitted in Hogwarts of their dreams, so even if something goes against their ego then they tend to remark it in a negative way. So basically expectations your experience at any university will depend on the kind of behavior and ego you carry in front of the faculty.

</string>
    <string name="uni129_4">Yes! There are ways with which you can cut down your expenses at WSU and one of such best is attaining scholarship. University provides scholarship for every program which is available in their campus. There are few easy steps mentioned by the university on their site, follow them and you’ll find a he drop in your fee expenditure.

</string>
    <string name="uni129_5">If asked upon anybody would say that they are satisfied with the kind of job they got after their graduation from WSU, but the problem is that job wasn’t offered by in campus placement in WSU. WSU conducts placement for such companies where they want their students to go in, not where the student wish to work at. Many of the students deny applying for in-campus placements and prefer searching for jobs on their own. So, before applying for any kind of placement within the campus kindly recheck the company’s history and they go on with the procedure.

</string>
    <string name="uni129_6">Easy-going, non-conservative, open minded, Saturday-football lovers and the bar gang is the kind of crowd you’ll find at WSU. It’s a ‘fun to study at’ kind of place where people love to party as much as they study. This kind of environment gives one a perfect ‘college life’ experience. Tips to consider would be that one must keep out of trouble and keep your attitude right; you\’ll survive and enjoy the best till you get your degree.

</string>
    <string name="uni129_7">The crowd is good, the campus is fun to chill at and the locality has few good places to visit over the weekend. When all the best things come together then money becomes an issue. Scholarships do help, but the fees and extra expenses are not affected with that much of discount, they still remain almost the same. If you wish to obtain a degree from a good university, then WSU can be the one but with its in-campus placement issues and high fees you must give a thought before applying for it.

    <string name="uni130_1">Dartmouth College is a private research university located in Hanover, New Hampshire. It was established as early as 1769 (yes, nearly 250 years ago) as part of the British Empire, and has over time achieved the Ivy League status. It has the lowest student enrollment amongst all Ivy League schools, which is why it isn’t too easy to get in inspite of the schools low rank. Students looking to Master in Engineering Management (MEM) should keep it as one of their top options.

</string>
    <string name="uni130_2">Dartmouth is made on a completely rural campus in Hanover. Spread over 269 acres, this Ivy League College has a beautiful blend of ancient as well modernistic buildings. All of which have absolutely state-of-the-art infrastructure and facilities. The Thayer School of Engineering, where you probably will be, has its own buildings as well as the dedicated library which has tens of thousands of volumes covering all possible areas. Sadly, there are no cafeterias and bars on the campus.

</string>
    <string name="uni130_3">Dartmouth is popular mainly for its undergraduate courses and less for its graduate programs. Although it has been ranked ahead of universities like Harvard, Stanford, and Yale for its undergrad programs, it somehow hasn’t built a reputation for its degree courses inspite of high levels of research activities. That being sad, the teaching process at Dartmouth is completely unique, in ways known only by the excellent faculty there.

</string>
    <string name="uni130_4">If you get into Dartmouth and are able to demonstrate the need of financial aid, you can be rest assured, you will get it.

</string>
    <string name="uni130_5">The engineering jobs at Dartmouth aren’t really out of the world, but fortunately the Career Centre is helpful and ensures you get something you like.

</string>
    <string name="uni130_6">While the under grad students are definitely classified under the nerd category, graduate students aren’t exactly so perhaps because they aren’t that smart. The entire graduate strength is only about 1500 students so its not particularly easy to find people who interest you and, to be honest neither is it once you venture outside college. We would say that Dartmouth is more for the aesthetically rather socially inclined, and here we’re talking about nature.
</string>
    <string name="uni130_7">If only there is Graduation programs were half as their undergrad, Dartmouth would have been much higher in the rank list for every course.

    <string name="uni132_7">Kent State is a large school that provides a suburban setting. The professors seem to be nice and also the learning environment is conducive. However, it may not be one of the better places to study STEM courses because most of the funding and focus is for the successful ones such as fashion, business, and nursing. Students with an athletics background may find their place here.

</string>
    <string name="uni133_3">North Texas counts with a group of professors who are committed to their job and mostly to the research projects, of course there always positives and negatives but that also depends on the perspective of the students. However, one thing that can\'t be debated is that professors are knowledgeable, respectable, and always available offering academic help. It is said that the school of Music counts with amazing professors that care about the success of their students and are always supportive and passionate about the topics they teach.

</string>

    <string name="uni134_1">Founded in 1801, the University of South Carolina is a public, co-educational research university located in Columbia, South Carolina with seven sister campuses. It covers over 359 acres in downtown Columbia which not far that from the South Carolina State House. The university offers more than 350 programs of study including the doctoral degrees from fourteen different degree-granting colleges and schools. The University of South Carolina has an enrollment of approximately 49,220 students, with 33,575 on the main Columbia campus as of fall 2015 which is pretty good in number considering the locality in fact.

</string>
    <string name="uni134_2">Built in 1801, the campus is considered in the list of must visit heritage sites in Carolina. The main campus building is right in the center of the city and is gives a vintage look to whole locality.

</string>
    <string name="uni134_3">The faculty at USC is considered as one of the best faculty in the state of South Carolina. The appointed teachers or professors are well respected everywhere and few of them sure must have had the pleasure to receive some honorary award somewhere, although teaching is a tough job but teaching at USC is a little more tough than that of other university because professors are strictly given guidelines to not to avoid any student’s doubts or problems. The professors are helpful, even if they do not want to be. They wouldn’t care about you but the university rules ask them to treat you as a mamma’s boy. But, don’t take any advantage of that, similar rules are applied to students and the consequences for ignoring them would be straight rustication.

</string>
    <string name="uni134_4">USC provides various kinds of financial aids to students those who cannot afford fees for the university. There are various other scholarship programs that can be availed by foreign students by applying for the entrance while filling in the admission form.

</string>
    <string name="uni134_5">Life after USC has been pretty over rated; the actual census says something else. The students are pretty happy with the university’s educational outcome. There are campus placements held after every final semester, but the students are always unsatisfied with the job profile. The outcome of every placement turns into 40% of students being employed as white collars, which is good but every time students do not prefer to be one of them. There is a low percentile of students who get the job that they wish to be in and even the starting average salary for an employer is a bit low as expected. So, do not wish to get the best job immediately after graduation because unlike other universities this university has contacts within the state of South Carolina and not outside that.

</string>
    <string name="uni134_6">The crowd at USC is mixed population of various students from different part of the world. If you are studying at USC then you would find a cultural mix from various parts which helps you understand different cultures and learn their habits and understand their society. Sometimes it is easier to live with people from different culture but at times the conversation turns into a ego clash, so to avoid that respect everybody out there because as a foreigner you’d be left out of your social life if things don’t work out well with them.

</string>
    <string name="uni134_7">The University Of South Carolina is indeed a great university, but just bound within the state of South Carolina. The university has a great name but the exposure for a USC graduate is only limited within the state. It is not because the student isn’t bright it is because the university has a big competition outside the state boundaries and one of them is Yale. At an average 70% of employees prefer Yale over any other university and that is not because of its name it is more because of the reason that Yale has done its marketing well. It has kept its sister school close but marketing strategies closer which other universities couldn’t gather. Else apart from that if you desire a foreign degree with a good outcome from the university and do not expect much from life apart from a government house and few extra monthly cheques for your wife to shop at Burberry, then this is the place to go to.

    <string name="uni136_1">Washington University in St. Louis (Wash. U, or WUSTL) is a private research university located in St. Louis, Missouri, United States. Founded in 1853, and named after George Washington, the university has students and faculty from all 50 U.S. states and more than 120 countries. To sell its seats for admission, just the name is enough. University has been a dream college for every student and the graduates from here are preferred all over the United States. With an enrollment of 14,000 students the university keeps its originality by conducting an entrance which is not everyone’s piece of work to complete and get passing marks in it.

</string>
    <string name="uni136_2">With a total of 2,500 acres of massive campus, the university is divided in to 4 different campuses namely Danforth Campus, Medical Campus, North and West Campuses and Tyson Research Center. Over 8 grounds and 9 parks the campus is more like a sanctuary than university. The metro’s disturbance cannot be felt within the campus. Established in 1853, the university has few heritage buildings and one of the best libraries of U.S is present within the campus.

</string>
    <string name="uni136_3">Once you decide to take admissions in WUSTL then you should be aware of the fact that the best in class professors are about to conduct your class. Undoubtedly the professors of engineering college are the best as they are awarded at various annual functions on regular basis. The problem is with the arts department of the university. The university does not pay much attention to its arts department as they do not have abundance of students there. Professors for arts at WUSTL are remarked as lazy and they do not pay much attention on solving a student’s doubt. Else, the university has great faculty excluding few sections of the departments.

</string>
    <string name="uni136_4">According to data collected in 2015 63% full time students receive federal aid and the average amount is $381, 6% of students receive State/Local grants and the average amount is $2,319, 47% receive institutional grants and the average institutional award is $29,192 and 23% receive student loans and the average amount is $6,185. Even after providing these many facilities for students, the fact of the high fees still remains there. The university sells seat over its name and now day’s education is more like a business than sharing knowledge.

</string>
    <string name="uni136_5">Even though the university is one of the most renowned, people are unaware about its name. The university has good contacts within the state of Washington and tries its best to communicate with those MNCs for recruiting students from the university. An average salary of a graduate from WUSTL can be $61,967 as starting annual salary and $251,923 annual salary after 10 years of experience. These figures are enough to talk about the after-life of a graduate from WUSTL.

</string>
    <string name="uni136_6">At an average population of WUSTL is defined as smart, mannerly and football lovers. If you are living within the bounds of WUSTL then your aim should be getting good scores and trying to be in university’s football team. Making friends it easy as everyone is easy minded and belong to diverse culture. Almost 60% of the population is foreigner and knowing new people of new culture is everyone’s passion. So living with comfort and friends in a friendly environment is the kind of life you’d experience at WUSTL.

</string>
    <string name="uni136_7">With that kind of high fees one can expect the kind of students that must be taking admissions in this university. In a term you can say that the crowd is elitist, but if they are friendly who cares. The better side is that the university has good professors and smart crowd, but this rich living might sway away your mind and you might end up buying expensive stuff to feel equal to all others in university. If you end up in this university, keep your thoughts simple and do not get carried away with such things.

    <string name="uni137_1">University of Delaware is a privately chartered university, albeit with some state assistance as well, which makes it a unique private as well as a public university. Established as early as 1743, UDel has its main campus in Newark, Delaware. Although it is considered a gettable university, thanks to excellent intake, you shouldn’t read much into this since it’s a really good school, which is greatly helped by its strategic location. Speaking of which…

</string>
    <string name="uni137_2">The suburban campus of UDel spreads across about 2,300 acres and is divided into seven sections, one being engineering of course. Many of the buildings and research laboratories are newly constructed and are really sights to see with state-of-the-art equipment as well.

</string>
    <string name="uni137_3">The engineering faculty at University of Delaware is known primarily for its exploits in the field of Chemistry, although students say that all professors are really really good. Professors are extremely understanding, very helpful, and are more than willing to go out of their way for their students.

    <string name="uni137_4">The engineering faculty at University of Delaware is known primarily for its exploits in the field of Chemistry, although students say that all professors are really really good.

</string>
    <string name="uni137_5">Difficult, but not impossible. You’d had better present a good enough case for it, though, and by that we’re talking about your acads.

</string>
    <string name="uni137_6">Since UDel is a pretty large school, you can expect to find students of all colours, shapes and sizes, and you’ll be surprised by the number of beautiful people you find here. The undergrads, especially, are known for their hotness. Don’t get scared, though – you won’t be an outcast even if you aren’t a looker. People here are generally quite friendly and adjusting, and if you drink it’s a big big bonus. Drinking is almost a religion here, which is why you see a number of bars in the otherwise residential areas around. So if you get out of your house on a random weeknight and you find a hot, very inebriated girl asking you for a ride back home, don’t start pinching yourself – it isn’t a dream.

</string>
    <string name="uni137_7">Not the best university in the world, but probably the best in Delaware. That’s not saying too much, of course, but if you have an average profile, you could do better than not apply here.

</string>

    <string name="uni138_1">University of Missouri, Kansas City or UMKC is part of the University of Missouri system of colleges and was established in early 1930. It is a small campus of less than 150 acres and has a few masters’ degree programmes to offer in Engineering.

</string>
    <string name="uni138_2">UMKC is just a small city campus where facilities are crammed up. It isn’t as open as a more famous University campus but yes, top facilities are up and running. The campus is always clean and looks good overall. Even the libraries are good (the college isn’t as good for Engineering as it is for its other streams). Overall, the campus infrastructure is good and as long as the college is in the heart of the city, why would students bother!

</string>
    <string name="uni138_3">Although the University came into existence in the 1930s, its school of Engineering has been established only recently in 2001. There are very few masters’ programmes in UMKC, just four in number which obviously means that the domain of engineering studies is really small in UMKC. The faculty is fine, a very small lot though. Classes are small and yes, students do get some effective attention during their work.

</string>
    <string name="uni138_4">Students can approach the University for the Dean’s International Scholar Award (DISA) which can help an international student immensely. The International Student Ambassador Program Scholarship is awarded to eight UMKC international students every year, which too, is helpful.Students can also work part time to meet their expenses; the college helps the students to secure such on campus or off campus jobs.

</string>
    <string name="uni138_5">UMKC has the advantage of being situated in a big city which makes it really easy for students to network with the bigwigs of Engineering and sciences especially in the IT and computers industry. This really helps eventually to secure jobs, internships and project partnerships.

</string>
    <string name="uni138_6">Crowd in UMKC is just fine. The in state students are generally from the city and are rich while a lot of International students join UKMC only for its low tuition even though it’s a tier two college. As most facilities are available in the campus, the crowd makes the best use of it. You will surely find your match and enjoy the social life but this isn’t place to be for the great American academic dream.Campus life, though, is amazing. It is a city, you can expect the best of all options to chill and enjoy.

</string>
    <string name="uni138_7">For is tolerable weather, amazing city atmosphere and above average facilities UMKC is worth the choice only if you fail to get any other college of your choice and still want to pursue a masters in the USA. You really can take the risk as not everybody is jobless after graduating, after all.

    <string name="uni139_1">Founded in 1972, Florida International University has grown to become one of the largest and most recognized universities in the state. Located in the balmy city of Miami, the FIU comes with two campuses; the first campus in the Modesto A. Maidique campus in the west Miami-Dad county and the second campus called the Biscayne Bay campus in North Miami.
</string>
    <string name="uni139_2">Located in a huge 344 acres of land, the University has tones of infrastructure that is spread all around the campus. With student housing, administrative offices, parks and stadiums, FIU has all the facilities that you would need. Multiple libraries and the athletic areas such as the FIU Stadium, FIU Arena and the baseball stadiums are the main attractions. The engineering building is also famous for housing the university’s Motorola Nanofabrication Research Facility.
</string>
    <string name="uni139_3">The student-faculty ratio in FIU is 26:1 and only 22% of the classes have fewer than 20 students. Knowing the most popular subjects to be business, management, Social Sciences, Psychology and more, the faculty is well-versed in their subjects and offer top of the line education. Under the guidance of the Director S.S.Iyengar, the teaching staff of 46 covers a variety of subjects.

</string>
    <string name="uni139_4">While the educational fees of the university can be quite high for out of the state and international students, there are a lot of scholarships available for the Hispanic and international community. With job opportunities available in the college itself, 71.8% of the students receive some form of financial aid.
</string>
    <string name="uni139_5">With a good retention rate, most of the students go on to be placed in extremely good jobs or come back to the university to complete their studies in the graduation or PhD level. While the difference in the degrees make up for the difference in salaries, the companies that come every year differ according to the amount of people who actually complete their degree in each year.

</string>
    <string name="uni139_6">With over 60% of the students being Hispanic, you can be sure that there is a huge diversity in the students. This will make for interesting conversations and friends as you will not only meet new people but can easily find your kind of friends. There are a lot of clubs such as the arts club, music club, robtics club and more where you can find people with similar interests as yours and hone your skills at the same time.
</string>
    <string name="uni139_7">Although Florida International University has a large student body and a number of activities to enjoy, you need to see if the course you are interested in will give you the correct results. With a low succession rate by students, it is better to opt for this university if the courses offered are apt for your interest. If you are an international student, ensure that you have a good budget just for your fees as well or you will find it hard to cover your expenses every year.

    <string name="uni140_1">Established in 1969, The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) is a state research university in San Antonio, Texas, United States. With over 28,000 students, it is the largest university in San Antonio and the eighth-largest (2014) in the state of Texas. UTSA embraces the multicultural traditions of South Texas, serves as a center for intellectual and creative resources, and is a catalyst for the economic development of Texas. In short, the university is the lone wolf of economic boost in Texas. But, the point is that does it thrive in each and every section mentioned below? Lets see!

</string>
    <string name="uni140_2">UTSA has three campuses span over 747 acres of land, with its main campus being the largest in the University of Texas System. UTSA offers a wide array of academic studies, with 133 undergraduate, 51 graduate and 24 doctoral programs. UTSA is famous for one thing and that is the amount of money that has been spent to construct and renovate buildings in the campus. The university has beautiful constructions and students find its library one of the most pleasant places in the campus. Though the campus is pretty small it might get difficult for you to look for a quiet place to spend your time at but as an alternative you always have the library. The cafe inside the campus is good which does not provide a lot of food options but tastes better than what weve heard till now. If you feel like having some other kind of food then there are a lot of options available outside the campus. Believe it or not, the campus is looks-wise deceiving enough to make up your mind for admissions in this university.

</string>
    <string name="uni140_3">Even though in 2005 UTSA had replaced 20 members from their staff due to their low standards of teaching level, students are still complaining about the staff available there. There are few good professors, but unless a professor denies teaching you syllabus until then one shouldnt define them as incompetent. Eventually, no one can decide the level of faculty unless one has experienced it. But fortunately some students have found best professors there at UTSA and were happy to learn under their guidance.

    <string name="uni140_5">Eventually most of the alumni have confirmed that there were not many in-campus placements happening while they were in college, but they did agree to a lot of socials happen within the campus which helped them get in touch with the alumni of their time and make contacts with them. The factual figures seem pretty happy with the way life after UTSA evaluates. Over all 67% of graduates from UTSA seem to be happy with their job and are earning a good amount of annual income. So judging the after-life from 1000 miles away is quite a difficult job. Also there have been cases where few alumni mentioned that not a lot of recruitment companies were happy to see the certificate from UTSA.

</string>
    <string name="uni140_6">Well, the crowd and campus life cant be judged from overview perspective. One must experience it to know more about it, but technically there is no possible way that you can take admissions just to experience the campus life and then decide whether you want to stay there or no. Compared to other city campus universities this university would not be that much fun. There are places where you can enjoy a bit such as the cafes inside campus, but dont expect food to be on delicious level. It is easy to make friends though as people are not to ignorant for foreigners there. 3/4th of the crowd at UTSA is from Austin and you might find a lot of groups already from the fresher point of view as these people know each other already but all you need to do is be sweet and get friends not just for fun but for group work too.

</string>
    <string name="uni140_7">Well, being a city based university UTSA does not infatuate one to gather their guts to take admission without any second thought. The only best part about this university is their sports section and the administration makes sure that they sell good on the basis of campaigns based on sports to gather more student attention. The infrastructure is good but housing cost might just be a confirmed NO from an average students point of view. A lot of students compare UTSA with University of Austin for some obvious reasons even though both the schools do not have direct connections. But, from fun point of view UTSA has no chance to win your admissions. The only good reason to attend UTSA would be its good education at affordable pricing. If you have any friends or family staying over at San Antonio then this university can be a lot fun at cheaper prices as you wont have to spend on housing cost. A good suggestion would be that if you want just a degree from any foreign college then UTSA is a good place to consider only if you are able to manage housing under your budget.

    <string name="uni141_1">Founded in 1888 as Utah\'s agricultural college, the Utah State University (USU) is a public research university in Logan. With a total of 29,000 students the university now offers programs in liberal arts, engineering, business, economics, natural resource sciences, as well as nationally ranked elementary &amp; secondary education programs. The university has eight colleges and offers a total of 176 bachelor\'s degrees, 97 master\'s degrees, and 38 doctoral degrees. The university\’s name is as good as its digit around United States.

</string>
    <string name="uni141_2">The Logan campus is built on 2sq Km of area and the suburban is built over 500 acres of land, both the campuses are pretty big as compared to their locality. As the campus was built more than a century back, it does have a heritage feel to itself. The surroundings are beautiful and green; all you will hear is sounds of bird’s chirpings. Full of parks and libraries, the campus is better known for its heritage value and has beautiful buildings of the 17th and 18th century.

</string>
    <string name="uni141_4">The university conducts few specific programs and exams for those who are interested in attaining scholarship. Forms for this are available on their website, the earlier you apply the better become your chances for attaining the scholarship.

</string>
    <string name="uni141_5">The university has a good name in every industry. Having one of the best agricultural colleges, the university has made quite a name in that specific industry. The average annual income of a USU pass out is 72,000 US$ which by far is good as compared to other universities in the same range of education and fee structure. Students from USU are satisfied with their jobs and as per the census 75% of them agree that USU was the reason behind their career success.

</string>
    <string name="uni141_6">Crowd at USU is diverse as Logan does not have that huge population to keep the majority students as locals in the university. The better side of it is if you do not know one’s background you tend to judge that person less, with the same reason there are great chances that you might end up making best friends for lifetime. There are places to hang-out in university too, such as its canteen which is popular because of its meals and parks which are maintained well by the administration. Living in the campus would be quite an experience at USU.

</string>
    <string name="uni141_7">Criticizing the university would be wrong at such a scenario, the teachers are good but the administration is strict has nothing to do with your choices. First of all you must see if you’d be able to live in such a place of isolation which has nothing but the university itself? Then if you would like to stay, the university has a beauty which gives you peace and education can be taken on a serious note. But, if you get in matters with the administration, the remaining life of your education at USU can get at risk. Choice is yours, pros and cons will always follow.

    <string name="uni142_1">Established on September 10th 1794, The University of Tennessee (also referred to as UT) is an American public sun and land-grant university headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. With nine undergraduate colleges and eleven graduate colleges UT hosts almost 28,000 students from all 50 states and more than 100 foreign countries. In its 2014 ranking of universities, U.S. News &amp; World Report ranked UT 106th among all national universities which is a pretty prestigious number to take pride in. Since ages the university has gathered quite an attention amongst students and the congressmen in U.S which keeps it in the limelight throughout the year. Here comes the review of one of the most prestigious and talked about university in U.S.

</string>
    <string name="uni142_2">A huge campus of 2138 acres is a lot more space to explore for a year at least. Seriously UTK is one of the biggest university campuses ever established. The buildings are comparatively new but the main university hall still remains intact since 1796. The campus buildings comprise of 576 acres of the total area and a new building is made every once in 5 years. The classes are large and give you a good amount of space to study. The best part about this campus is the main university hall; its old, a bit gothic and beautiful. There are few cafes and boutiques inside the campus but campus canteen generally provides mediocre food.

</string>
    <string name="uni142_3">Well, if I was a professor then the only way I would agree to teach at UTK would be for an exceptional salary because the university is like a State in itself where you dont have a social life like in a town or city. The place is full of bats and crows that give you a genuine vibe of woods from The Jungle Book. Nevertheless the place is peaceful so there are few professors who chose to settle here throughout their life. Professors are generally good and few of them are everybodys favorite. Professors at the Math department are considered as best in UTK. But, not just math professors even others are helpful, friendly and will help you at any doubt you take forward to them. There are no complaints registered on any faculty as far as teaching is concerned.

</string>
    <string name="uni142_4">Yes, just like any other university UTK provides scholarship, grants and students loan which will help you minus your total fee. The procedure for applying for a scholarship is easy but when you have to fill in all your documents for the paper work that is a load of work. And also if by chance you end up being in a heated argument with any of the administration staff then your scholarship might be at stake. Apart from all these benefits the university also allows student to work part-time within the university which helps them gain an amount which will at least help equalize their food and living cost.

</string>
    <string name="uni142_5">As per the data 37% of the students have acquired their job through University and are satisfied with it. There are few placements that are conducted within the campus but everyone is not lucky enough to find their perfect job in those campus placements. There are few campus parties and gathering which are conducted once in a quarter will help you get in touch with alumni but very few people turn up for those parties. You need to be really adamant and career focused to visit such place and gather all the contacts possible.

</string>
    <string name="uni142_6">The crowd at UTK comprises of Greek life in majority. The place is fun during the football season and everybody is looking forward to the weekend then. If you arent a sports person, then this might not interest you and there are high chances that you might end up being lonely during this season of the year but you have an alternative to complete your university assignments then. It is easy to make friends at UTK as a lot of students prefer living inside the campus. Rarely would you find any attitude or ego issues because by the end of the day everyone realizes the fact that they have to face you in these 2000 acres of land out of which 75% is covered with wilderness. Students prefer chilling at cafes because the canteen food is mediocre and cafs are full most of the time. It is generally a good place to spend your education time at.

</string>
    <string name="uni142_7">Considering the past and notable alumni of this university one can easily start falling in love with UTK but there are other factors to be considered such as why UTK if you have other affordable universities providing same course in a city setting? The marvelous campus isnt going to add up to your career, all it will give you is a bit of silence which will be disturbed eventually if a construction takes place within the campus, which regularly does. The academics and education quality is good but what about the food? No one has complimented the food till now; yes the cafes are good but let me remind you that those are expensive too. The crowd is good but all you will need to do is be same good to them. The only issue being the 48,000 US$ mark of fee, if you are simply going for the degree to States then this university is not worth your time because you can get that same degree at any other university at an affordable price but if youre looking forward for some fun and peace while you study and also you have the amount of funds required then you are welcome to apply by clicking on the website below, just beware of the administration staff; they can be irritating.

    <string name="uni148_1">University of Bridgeport is a relatively newer private University housed in a really small urban campus of less than 100 acres. The University was founded in 1927 and has a few Masters Courses in Engineering at the School of Engineering, UB.

</string>
    <string name="uni148_2">UB has a really small campus and considering that, the facilities are just fine. They have everything in place but nothing is extravagant. You get the perks of studying right next to the sea shore but apart from that there is nothing worth travelling from India to US.

</string>
    <string name="uni148_3">Well, UB has decent faculty as such, but would you go all the way to the US for just decent faculty? There are great teachers and also those whom you will despise. The professors are helpful though and will guide you on your work. If you are reading in Bridgeport or planning to enrol there, make sure you make an all out effort by yourself to do well.
</string>
    <string name="uni148_4">It is simply very easy to get a deduction on the already less expensive tuition fee at UB. The University offers scholarships with varied amount of waivers depending on test scores, merit and not essentially need based.

</string>
    <string name="uni148_5">Don’t expect much help from the University at the time of graduation. You will have to make way for yourself to secure a job. The alumni network is not as strong as other top schools and also, the prospects of securing a standard job is also not great in UB.

</string>
    <string name="uni148_6">Well, UB does score significant points when it comes to diversity and mix of crowd. You will find someone from almost every corner of the world. UB has also been awarded several times for being one of the most amiable and tolerant campuses in the USA. That said, not a lot is possible in the small campus as in facilities are mellowed down in accordance of the size of the campus. You will still find students working hard, keeping themselves busy and going to the city to chill. Overall, the crowd is decent and diverse, there are several clubs (a few Indian too) which are active and interesting. Crowd is fine; you will end up making good friends from countries that you never knew existed!

</string>
    <string name="uni148_7">There are those colleges which however bad turn out to be better than the average Indian colleges, University of Bridgeport is one of them. If you want to experience studying abroad and you are ready to shell out the reasonably less tuition fee here, go for the grabs!

The campus has great green areas that go along perfectly with the Harbor shoreline that surround the campus and is perfect for a run or go biking around at any time.

</string>
    <string name="uni152_3">The faculty in UMass Boston does have an interest in teaching and imparting knowledge to others. Half of the professors are experienced people, specialized in their specific area or as it is known they are “tenure-tracks” including poets Lloyd Schwartz (who was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism), author Padraig O\'Malley, feminist scholar Carol Cohn, economists Julie A. Nelson, political scientists Thomas Ferguson and more. On the other hand, although they are many experienced professors students complain is hard to get into classes since they fill up very quickly. Also, students claim it is difficult to communicate with the administration when they have a problem that they need to solve.

</string>
    <string name="uni152_4">The University of UMass Boston offers more than $150 million every year in financial aid to students and it usually comes from the Federal Government, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the UMass Boston. The type of aid depends on who is offering it, Federal funding usually offers Grants and Loans, the State funding sources offer only Grants and the UMass Boston offers the UMass Boston Fee Grant, Merit-Based Awards based on academic performance, the Academic Achievement Award, Dean\'s Scholarship, Beacon Scholarship and the Need-Based Tuition Credit.

If students have trouble finding and job, they can always take a look at the job list in Beacon Careers online website where jobs and internships are posted by the university.

</string>
    <string name="uni152_6">The crowd at the UMass is great, it has a large population when it comes to undergraduate students and the gender distribution is not paired with a percentage of 58% female - 42% male. The diversity on campus seems to be goof across all factors; the biggest communities after Americans are the Hispanic community followed by the Asian. On the other hand, many students complain about the campus social life since they claim there are no as many activities as it is expected and that campus is always under construction which makes it really messy but you can always find nice bars and clubs near the university area.

</string>
    <string name="uni152_7">For Massachusetts residents, it can be considerate a safe admission and the tuition could be very affordable. However, the rest of students can some type of aid except international that does not have it as easy. Student at the UMass Boston may have the opportunity to learn with great experience professor but classes seem to be crowded so there are a few of cons and pros to take in count when it comes to choosing this university.
